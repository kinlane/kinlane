<p><em>This is a post from my fellow Presidential Innovation Fellow Robert Read. His post the other morning on his Facebook stream really moved me. I thought it summed up this whole mess very well and wanted to share it with you!</em></p>
<p>I'm lucky. I'm furloughed, but my kid's education doesn't depend on it. I don't live month to month. I'm not at the beginning of my career, and I'm not a single parent. I took a cut in salary and left my family to go to Washington to answer the President's call to try to make government "cool" and efficient, and I work 70 hours a week to do it. I was handed a plum of a project which possibly will save the government a billion dollars in 2014, but the government just cost us all that and more.</p>
<p>We are now like a runner forced to stop mid-stride for one minute and then allowed to run for one minute---we expend more effort and cover less distance than running at a smooth pace. The cost of the shutdown, even if it is reversed tonight, has already been at least a billion, by my own humble reckoning. That assumes of course that you believe and that we have become a great nation because of good government, not in spite of bad government.</p>
<p>As duty demands, I'm going into work now to shut down the servers that host the Beta site for my project. It is the first day I haven't worn a tie in 4 months. One must always look on the bright side.</p>
<p>After I shut down my servers, I have to leave and am forbidden to do any work for the government as long as the shutdown lasts.</p>
