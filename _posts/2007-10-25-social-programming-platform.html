Ok. Now that I have been blogging somewhat successfully (what is successfully), I am starting to develop a rhythm. It is pretty erratic, but it is starting to flow and develop a voice. Well at least to me.<br />
<br />
So if you wish to read this blog it is more for my head to keep track and formulate some of the thoughts I am having about my evolution in the <a href="http://www.web20squad.us/">Social Media Space</a>.<br />
<br />
This blog is based upon a mind map I am creating in MindMeister, and will be publishing it to my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/">Kin Lane</a> web site as soon as it matures a little bit.<br />
<br />
So these are going to be pretty random, as I can I will link off the mind map as I publish it and / or I will try to outline off my site and link to each blog in some organized fashion, as I make sense of it.
