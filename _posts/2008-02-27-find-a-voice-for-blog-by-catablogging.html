Was readng a post on <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/">CopyBlogger</a> about <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/catablogging/">Catablogging</a>.   What is catablogging you ask?  Do we really need  new terminology for the way you blog?<br /><br /><em>A catablog is basically a blog that is designed to mix content and commerce in a very deliberate fashion. It's looking to attract people who are interested in buying things, but who are also interested in immersing themselves in the lifestyle surrounding the products.</em><br /><em></em><br />I thought the blog post described an interesting way of quickly developing a voice for your blog.  I think that is a big problem for most bloggers to gain traction.  I know I have.<br /><br />Catablogging essentially allows you to piggyback on an existing brand or product line and evolve your voice around that.<br /><br />This isn't necessarily somethinI am interested in doing, but I could see the value in making money by doing this.  Really getting to know a product, line of products and the customer / fan base around that.
