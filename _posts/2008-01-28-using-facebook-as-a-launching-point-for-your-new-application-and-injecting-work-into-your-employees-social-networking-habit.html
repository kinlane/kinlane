Was reading the post on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">Techcrunch</a> this morning called <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/28/huddle-uses-new-apps-and-facebook-to-take-on-basecamp/">Huddle uses new apps and Facebook to take on Basecamp</a>. <br /><br />Its interesting on several levels to see another Basecamp competitor as well as someone leverage facebook as a marketing tool for their new web applications.  How launching a Facebook can be a tool to drive new users to your application.<br /><br />I think it is also very interesting from the usage of Facebook and other social networks in the workplace.  I mentioned the article in the TimesOnline called <span style="font-family: georgia;"><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/career_and_jobs/recruiter_forum/article3255962.ece?Submitted=true">Learn to love social network sites</a> about workplace usage of social networks.  Huddles new application introduces potential value for the workplace in applications that run in social networks.<br /><br />I keep saying how companies need to embrace employees usage of social networks from a moral standpoint, work efficiency, and from their social media marketing strategy.<br /></span>
