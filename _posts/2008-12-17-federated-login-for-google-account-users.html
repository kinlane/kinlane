I have been working on a prototype for using the Federated Google Account login that uses the OpenID 2.0 standard.  Really a nice concept to offer for users who are heavy users of Google, Yahoo or other 3rd party service providers that have adopted OpenID.<p></p>
I am proposing offering a Login Using Google button on all our public application logins which then send a request to Google and allows the user to authenticate our domain(s) under their Google Account.<p></p>
Then they can utilize a single click login in the future without remembering yet another username and password.<p></p>
It is really slick I recommend checking out the <a href="Google Checkout - Prototype (Developer)">Google Federated Login informatio</a>n as well as reading up on the <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID Standard</a>.
