So Google has release offline access for Google Calendar to all users. Now I have offline access enabled for my key Google Apps.
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Google Mail (Gmail)</li>
	<li>Google Docs</li>
	<li>Google Calendars</li>
	<li>Google Reader</li>
</ul>
This allows me to use all these applications while I am not connected to the Internet on the road or otherwise. It is pretty exciting because it makes my Google Office Suite much more like Microsoft Office.<p></p>
I think it is a huge step forward for running your office suite in the clouds!
