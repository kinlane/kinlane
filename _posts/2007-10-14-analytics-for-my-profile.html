I have this great public profile showing all my stuff.<br /><br />Now of course I want analytics for all of this.  I want to know who is looking at what.  What is most popular and what is not.<br /><br />Show me which images were looked at today, what audio people heard.<br /><br />I want to be able to do this all without having to grab a piece of code from my Google analytics and paste it on a site.<br /><br />I just want to know.
