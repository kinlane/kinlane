I am a big advocate for educating politicians and our leaders on <a class="zem_slink" title="Cloud Computing" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Cloud_Computing">cloud computing</a> and what it can do to save money and open up our <a class="zem_slink" title="Government" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government">government</a> for more involvement by the public at large.<p></p>
I am amazed at how many leaders are already in the know about cloud computing.<p></p>
I was just reading a post on <a href="http://techdailydose.nationaljournal.com/2009/04/california-sec-of-state-keen-o.php">California Secretary of State Debra Bowen and Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner are both big cloud computing advocates</a>.<p></p>
Look for more information as I <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/kinlane.com/cloud-computing/research-areas">research their interest and exploration of cloud computing</a>.
