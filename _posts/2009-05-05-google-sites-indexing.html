I started doing some <a href="http://cloud.kinlane.com">research on cloud computing</a> a couple weeks ago. I have been watching the <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http://google.com">Google</a> search results for my name to see how long it took for this research to float up in my profile.<p></p>
It showed up at #28 now. I have seen other pages too show up below that.<p></p>
I am interested in seeing how quickly you can launch a site using <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Sites" rel="homepage" href="http://sites.google.com">Google sites</a> and have it indexed. I am using a sub domain off an existing domain. I link to this research from my blog regularly.<p></p>
In addition to the general <a href="http://cloud.kinlane.com">cloud computing research</a>, this project is an excercise to see what I can do using the Google Platform as a cloud environment as well.
