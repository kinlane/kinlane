Google has increased the file size limit of files stored in Google Docs, from 1GB to 10GB.
<p></p>
This increase, along with them <a title="Opening Up Google Docs to any File Type" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/upload-any-file-type-to-google-docs-with-api/">opening up Google Docs to any file type,</a> really establishes the platform as a viable cloud storage solution.
<p></p>
I did not encounter too many files that were to large, but when working with print files and high resolution images, sometimes I would exceed the limit.
<p></p>
To recap, heere are some of the key things I use Google Docs for now:
<ul class="blue">
	<li><a title="Word and Powerpoint File to PDF Conversion" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/04/convert-word-and-powerpoint-file-to-pdf-with-google-docs-api/">Word and Powerpoint File to PDF Conversion</a></li>
	<li><a title="Document Language Translation" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/document-translation-with-google-docs-api/">Document Language Translation</a></li>
	<li><a title="Optical Character Recognition" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/02/optical-character-recognition-ocr-with-google-docs-api/">Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</a></li>
	<li><a title="Resumable Upload" href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/resumable_upload.html">Resumable Upload </a></li>
	<li><a title="Secure Printing" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/03/secure-printing-with-google-cloud-print/">Secure Printing</a></li>
</ul>
I use Google Docs as a <a title="commercial document cloud printing platform" href="../../blog/blog_detail.php?ID=56">commercial document cloud printing platform</a>, for managing several kind of document printing:
<ul class="blue">
	<li><a title="Printing Single Sheets" href="../../blog/blog_detail.php?ID=128">Printing Single Sheets</a></li>
	<li><a title="Printing Bound Documents" href="../../blog/blog_detail.php?ID=129">Printing Bound Documents</a></li>
	<li><a title="Print Driver" href="../../blog/blog_detail.php?ID=130">Print Driver</a></li>
</ul>
Now there are still <a title="upload limits for Google Docs and Presentations" href="../../blog/blog_detail.php?ID=54">upload limits for Google Docs and Presentations</a>, and this also applies when you are converting them.
<p></p>
However when it comes to storing PDF for publishing and printing, you can now store files that are up to 10GB using your Google Docs account.
