Sometimes you notice things on the Internet and they just don't register for a while.  I've seen many sites displaying their code samples using a <a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank">Gist by Github</a>, but it hasn't really registered in my head for some reason.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-gist.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
I even created a custom snippet of code the other day for displaying code in my<a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/wordpress/">Wordpress</a> blog.   The other day I was going through <a href="http://www.mashape.com" target="_blank">Mashape's</a> documentation and their use of Gist for their <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/php/">PHP</a> <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> examples finally hit home.
<p></p>
Gist is a simple way to share snippets of code with others. All gists are git repositories, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and usable as a git repository.

I've been creating quite a few <a href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect" target="_blank">Github repositories</a> lately for <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/cloud-print/">Cloud Print</a>, but Gists are just what I'm looking for when blogging.  They work great for displaying code in technical blog posts without much work.  When done with the blog series I will post the final code in a complete form as a full Github repository.
