I spend a lot of time evaluating events and conferences. If I'm going to an event I deeply want to understand the event and how it speaks to me. From an industry perspective I am evaluating events for their approach and how they are managing it.<p></p>
Either way I want a programmatic approach to digesting the events information...in its entirety. I want to see:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Event Overview</li>
	<li>Sessions</li>
	<li>Exhibitors</li>
	<li>Speakers</li>
	<li>Keynotes</li>
</ul>
Of course this derived from my selfish desire to evaluate many sites with less effort. However I think it would help event managers syndicate their sites, contents and ultimately increase exposure.<p></p>
It would encourage developers to create event clients for browsing events during and after it happens. It would create more up to date directories of events in real-time.<p></p>
Just some random thoughts as I'm organizing them.
