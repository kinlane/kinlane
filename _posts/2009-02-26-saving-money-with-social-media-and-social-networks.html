I just did my taxes and broke down my spending for last year. I was newly divorced last year so I didn't have any restraing on my social spending budget. I won't give numbers on what I spent, but I was blown away what I spent wining and dining business customers as well as exploring the singles dating and partying scene.<p></p>
Well now that I am living way out in the woods I am putting myself on a forced money saving program. I don't eat out...or go out drinking. Period.<p></p>
Well this puts a real damper on my personal and business socializing. Bummer....<p></p>
Well it just is increasing my need to get creative in my usage of social networking to stay in touch with existing personal and business contacts.<p></p>
So I spend more time on MySpace, Facebook, LinkedIn....maintaining my blog and other social media and social networking tools.<p></p>
Cause i just can't afford to drive places...and eat and drink on the town.
