<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/Crocodoc-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />APIs are transforming the way we print.   I'm always looking for other APIs that compliment the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a>.
<p></p>
I recently added<a title="Crocodoc" href="http://www.crocodoc.com/">Crocodoc</a> to our application directory.  Crocodoc takes PDFs, Word documents, and PowerPoint presentations, and allows users to view and mark them up online.
<p></p>
Crocodoc also provides an<a title="web-based annotation APIs" href="http://crocodoc.com/api/">annotation API</a>,  allowing application developers to integrate PDF, Word, and Powerpoint annotation into their applications.

At <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.Mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> we do a lot of printing of classroom and learning management system materials for educators and trainers around the globe.
<p></p>
This got me thinking about new opportunities for developers to build innovative new applications that can be used by these educators and trainers.
<p></p>
In school, a used textbook can be of high value because of the notes written in the margins, and the highlighting of important parts.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/mimeo_connect_logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p></p>
With technology like Crocodoc Annotation API developers can allow educators and trainers to annotate documents from a single or multiple sources, and create enhanced versions of the document for specific classes or training sessions.
<p></p>
Using the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a> developers can allows these educators and trainers to print custom documents for their classes, providing a very unique, and personalized learning experience.
