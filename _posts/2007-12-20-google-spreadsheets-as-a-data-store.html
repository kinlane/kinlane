I just finished BETA testing the DocSyncer tool which will keep mycomputer synced with my Google Docs account.<br /><br />At first I had settings turned on to upload .html pages, which was a huge mistake....instantly it started publishing thousands of files of my local workstation, be careful.<br /><br />Once I did get my 800+ word and excel documents published synced up without any effort I started looking through them and searching on topics.  It was very interesting to find some items I don't even remember I have.<br /><br />The I pulled out a simple JavaScript for pulling a JSON feed from a Google Spreadsheet and connected it to a list of businesses I had for the Portland area.  Instantly I had published these business listings on the web using my Google Spreadsheet as a data store.<br /><br />Very cool stuff,  think it will be a while before everyone realizes the potential here.
