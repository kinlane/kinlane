I have been getting asked by friends for information on how to setup their own business. I think in these hard times getting a business going can be a very appealing alternative to finding another job.<p></p>
While I was doing the research I figured I'd just publish here for everyone to reference.<p></p>
This generally applies to starting a business in Oregon, because that is where I am located.<p></p>
First go to the State of Oregon and fill out the <a href="http://www.sos.state.or.us/corporation/forms/business.htm" target="_blank">Assumed Business Name (ABN) new registration form</a>.<p></p>
I assume you will be just starting a business for yourself, nothing too complicated.<p></p>
You can fill out online or print and mail in. It costs you $50.00 currently.<p></p>
You should receive in the mail in a few days or if you do online it should be quicker. You will then have a <strong><em>State of Oregon Business Registry Number</em></strong>.<p></p>
You will then take this State of Oregon Business Registry Number and go register for an <strong><em><a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=102767,00.html" target="_blank">Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a></em></strong>.<p></p>
You can do this online or print and mail in as well. Then you will receive the equivalent of a Social Security Number for your business.<p></p>
With an <strong><em>State of Oregon Business Registry Number </em></strong>and <strong><em>Employer Identification Number (EIN)</em></strong> you now have a basic business entity.<p></p>
You can now go to the bank with both these forms / numbers and get a business bank account.<p></p>
With a business entity and bank account you can now conduct business under your assumed business name. You can receive checks and other payments for business.<p></p>
There are a lot of other things you can do now that you have a business. I recommend keeping track of your money with <a href="http://oe.quickbooks.com/" target="_blank">Quickbooks Online</a> as your first step.<p></p>
More to come later....
