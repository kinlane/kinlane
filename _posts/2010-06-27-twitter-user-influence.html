When harvesting thousands of Twitter profiles and evaluating them at a macro level....you really have to come up with a definition of what is a quality or influential Twitter user.<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Twitter" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p></p>
What makes a Twitter user influential:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Number of Followers</li>
	<li>Number of Retweets</li>
	<li>Number of Tweets</li>
	<li>Contextual relevance of Tweets</li>
</ul>
You need to look beyond a single profile, a profile is the sum of the quality of its followers as well. Depending on the conversation your participating in, the quality and relevance of Twitters users may vary in unexpected ways.

So much to consider.
