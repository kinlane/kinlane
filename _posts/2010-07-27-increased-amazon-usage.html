<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Amazon Web Services" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Once again I'm pushing the limits of what I"m allowed within an Amazon Web Services account. I need more server instances and more reserved IP addresses. So I have to go to the form(s) Amazon provides to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request/" target="_blank">Request to Increase Amazon EC2 Instance Limit</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/eip_limit_request/" target="_blank">Request to Increase Elastic IP Address Limit</a></li>
</ul>
They take about 3-5 days to get back to you and let you know if you are approved. I've never been denied, because all the accounts I run are for reputable companies. Its an interesting control feature for managing the quality of tenants on the Amazon Cloud.
