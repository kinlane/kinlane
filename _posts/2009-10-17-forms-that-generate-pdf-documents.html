Was just checking out a cool service called <a href="http://www.doculicious.com">doculicious</a>. It allows people to create <a href="http://www.doculicious.com">HTML forms that generate PDF</a> and email them to you when the form is submitted.<p></p>
It is a inexpensive and easy way to collect users data and create a legible records of their information. They also provide a few other features:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Email submission when forms are submitted</li>
	<li>Embed the forms in your own web site</li>
	<li>Export all data collected into popular formats</li>
</ul>
Overall a pretty cool tool. I would say this web service falls under my category of doing one thing and doing it well.<p></p>
It is a simple tool that solves a problem well, and provides some added features allowing you to get maximum value.
