I use quite a few different Firefox Add-Ons. I use Amazon S3 Firefox Organizer, EC2 UI, Google Notebook, coCommnet, Shareaholic, just to name a few.<br />
<br />
My right click, tray and toolbar is just getting very crowded.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if someone logically built out a framework for these to display. I hope with Firefox 3.0 coming out they find a solution.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if I could manage what showed up where.
