I strongly believe in the cloud, and more specifically in <a class="zem_slink" title="Amazon" rel="homepage" href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a>'s approach to <a class="zem_slink" title="Cloud Computing" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Cloud_Computing">cloud computing</a>. I constantly battle people on my decision to use the cloud for my core IT infrastructure. It allows me to scale my infrastructure as needed and gave a completely new face to my IT strategy and operations.<p></p>
I can launch new server roles to meet business goals I have from scaling <a class="zem_slink" title="Web server" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web servers</a> all the way to launching temporary infrastructure to support large email blasts. It definitely introduces some new problems such as security, privacy, backups, etc. All the usual cloud computing concerns.<p></p>
Many of the concerns are valid, but can be dealt with with properly planning and maintenance (which should be done in or out of cloud). No matter how much evidence I have to backup my claims I still get the flack from naysayers who just haven't taken the time to really understand the cloud.<p></p>
Just like many of the people who jump on the cloud because its trendy, the other side opposes the cloud for the exact same reasons.<p></p>
My conviction was starting to wear thin during this 3 week saga with <a class="zem_slink" title="Trend Micro" rel="homepage" href="http://www.trendmicro.com">Trend Micro</a>. Everyone faulted the cloud. Even my boss came to me and said tell Amazon if they can't fix we are moving off the cloud. TrendMicro, <a class="zem_slink" title="FWB: SAP" rel="stockexchange" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SAP.F">SAP</a> IT in Germany, and many people on the message boards said just use a "real" infrastructure to send your emails. Get off the cloud.<p></p>
Amazons decision to give us v <a class="zem_slink" title="Reverse DNS lookup" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup">reverse DNS</a> on our eIP addresses has restored my conviction and faith in my decision to use the cloud for my IT infrastructure. I don't think the cloud is for everyone. I don't just blindly evangelize the cloud for every situation. However for me it works. It meets my needs and helps us deliver the quality of service our clients are looking for.<p></p>
Thanks Amazon.
