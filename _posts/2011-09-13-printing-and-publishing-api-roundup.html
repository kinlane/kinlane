For example, if you have yor own CRM system and would like your users to send cards from it, you can use our API so your CRM system can talk back and forth with Enthusem. If you wanted to create a branded card store for your users, you could create your own user interface with your own branding, then tie into Enthusem's backend to handle the fulfillment. In order to correctly use our API, your developer must know how to create an HTTP form POST and how to parse an XML response.
