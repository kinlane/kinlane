I have been through some major changes lately. Feel like I am really moving on into the 2nd half of my life. (Mid-Life...don't like that?). Anyways I recently went through a divorce with my wife Ishbel. I am learning how to spend time with my daughter Kaia both virtually, phone and in scheduled weekend times.
<p></p>For the first time I do not have any entrepreneurial aspirations. I have chosen to end all my business relationships I have had going with various individuals and companies and move on.
<p></p>I am now working with Web Events Global as the VP of Technology. I am working to understand their technology and industry and lead the charge to bring the company into its next phase of growth and development.
<p></p>It is a new time in my life and I am very excited about. I feel very calm and at peace with where I am at and going. I will be working exclusively for Web Events Global and spend time on my personal life and will be writing on various topics I find important.
