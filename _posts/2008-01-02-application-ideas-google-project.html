I have this notebook of application ideas that I have from time to time.  Its overflowing with lots of stupid ideas. <br /><br />So I am just going to start posting them here and see if someone has done something like it out there or maybe someone will get motivated and do it for me.<br /><br />Most ideas I have if I perform a little due diligence, I can find someone who is doing something similar.  However some I think are unique.<br /><br />Here we go:  <br /><br />I would like a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Google Project Tracking</span> solution to bring all my users, email, tasks, blogs, videos, docs, notebooks, events, and all my other stuff under one umbrella on the Google Platform.  It would work nicely with <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> task system.
