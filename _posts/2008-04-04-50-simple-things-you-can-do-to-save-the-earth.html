My wife and I just finished launching a new site for a client called <a href="http://www.50simplethings.com/">50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth</a>.  It is the revised, updated edition of a book originally released in the 1990's and was New York Times bestseller.<br /><br />We have been working hard for 3 months to design, develop and launch the site to support he book's release by Earth Day.<br /><br />It is a significant site for us.  It is our first major release on the <a href="http://www.originalwebsolutions.com">Original Web Solutions Version 4.0 Architecture</a> and if I must say is a really nice site. <br /><br />We are really proud of the design and architecture.  It uses the <a href="http://www.originalwebsolutions.com">OWS Network</a> build methodology deployed on the <a href="http://www.mosso.com/">Mosso Hosting Cloud</a> to support the amount of traffic.  In the first 12 hours we have had 500 people. <br /><br />Also this site is exciting because of its simple approach to enlightening the world about little things they can do to save the world!<br /><br />Make sure and check it out.  <a href="http://www.50simplethings.com">www.50simplethings.com</a>.
