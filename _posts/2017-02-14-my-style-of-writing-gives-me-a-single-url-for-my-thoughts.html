<p>I was just having a conversation with a friend on a social network about test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven&nbsp;development (BDD), as we progressed through the conversation I used both my blogs kinlane.com and apievangelist.com as references for thoughts I've had on the subject, providing them with a single URL to get more information from me.</p>
<p>I shared URLs for 3-5 ideas/thoughts I've had on the subject, giving me a much better way to recall what I know and thoughts I've had -- from within my domain. I have 10 years of posts on kinlane.com, and I am approaching 7 years on apievangelist.com. This gives me a rich and efficient way to recall thoughts I've&nbsp;had, build on them, and quickly share and convey these thoughts to others using URLs--this is why I tell stories.</p>
<p>This process also drives people to my websites, hopefully building trust with them when it comes to my domains. When you want information on APIs, you go to apievangelist.com. When you want slightly deranged rants about technology that may or may not make sense, you go to kinlane.com. I'm working on improved tagging across my content, something that ultimately is a manual thing, as nobody knows the content of my work like I do--not even the AIs and machine learningz.</p>
<p>I do not obsess over SEO for my websites. The natural progression of my research, and focus on helping people understand the world of APIs, lends itself nicely to having a wealth of links, and interconnected stories about a wide range of topics I am passionate about--which translates to some healthy organically generated SEO. Talking through this stuff helps me execute on this all in a more consistent way--the more I write, the ideas I have, and the more URLs I have to share. Which makes all of this go round for me, and hopefully you along the way.</p>
