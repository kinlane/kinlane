As I was browsing Bug Labs listing of little programmable gadgets I was getting all excited and immediately wanted to share with my other geeky friends on Facebook.<p></p>
So I started looking around for a share button....nothing.<p></p>
It is common to see all the common share buttons on blogs these days. Anywhere there is news and blogs you see the share options. You just don't see them for products yet.<p></p>
Definitely something business owners should do to ensure the viral growth of all their products is to provide standard sharing buttons so we can share any of your products or product lines to our Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other popular social networks.
