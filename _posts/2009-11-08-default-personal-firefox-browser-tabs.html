When I start my day I tend to open one browser and deploy all my work / business related applications and one browser for all my personal related applications.<p></p>
My personal browser tabs have been:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Gmail</li>
	<li>Google Calendar w/ Google Tasks Bar</li>
	<li>Google News which switches to Google Reader after the morning</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>Wordpress (www.kinlane.com)</li>
</ul>
It has been this way for a while. I am now noticing a new shift in my personal default browser setup. I am seeing the following apps:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Gmail</li>
	<li>Google Voice</li>
	<li>Google Wave</li>
	<li>Google Calendar w/ Google Tasks Bar</li>
	<li>Google News which switches to Google Reader after the morning</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>LinkedIn</li>
	<li>Wordpress (www.kinlane.com)</li>
</ul>
This is just what I have open by default in my Firefox browser. There are more tools I use as desktop apps as well as apps for the business.<p></p>
I will work on outlining these later.
