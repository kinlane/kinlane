In every company I work for we deal with resource shortages all over the place, either due to budgetary constraints or lack of skilled talent in the area.<br /><br />Either way many projects suffer and take a lot of time.  I was reading a post from <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED </a>today on new crowdsourcing site <a href="http://beta.kluster.com/">Kluster</a>.  Its another new attempt at harnessing the power of the crowd and putting it to use to create a better solution to a problem.<br /><br />It really allows you to tap a small or large group of people around a marketing idea, product launch or other viral style campaign.<br /><br />I have played around with the idea of using these groups such as <a href="http://www.pixish.com/">Pixish</a> when it comes to Logo creation or graphic design interfaces for widgets, etc.<br /><br />It is so new and a little scary, and tough to get budget approval for these sorts of things.<br /><br />I will give them each a shot in the next couple of months.
