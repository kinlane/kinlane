I was just watching <a href="http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/">Bill Maher</a> and was listening to their discussion on Kevin Phillips book called<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Bad-Money/Kevin-Phillips/e/9780670019076/"> Bad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism,</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornel_West">Cornel West</a> said something that summed up how sad things really are:<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We can see how sad this really is.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If we really want to tell the truth in a powerful way.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We have corporate greed running a muck.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We don't have enough jobs with a living wage for fellow citizens.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Unavailable health care and child care for millions.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Disgraceful school systems.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Failing infrastructure.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Then you have a political sphere where you can't have a critical debate or dialogue about these issues.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Then we have imperial occupation in Iraq.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">That is the makings the collapse of an empire.</span><br /><br />Cornel West said several things that were extremely well spoken and enlightening, but this statement really summed up my concerns at the moment during this election.
