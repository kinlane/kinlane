The potential of decentralized technologies on the Internet is far greater than their counterparts.  One such technology is <a href="http://xmpp.org/" target="_blank">XMPP</a>,  Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol or XMPP, is an open technology for real-time communication, which you find in instant messaging, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, and content syndication applications.

I am diving into the protocol while building commercial print applications that utilize the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Print</a> protocol.    Using the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/docs/proxyinterfaces.html" target="_blank">Google Cloud Print Services API</a> I can register commercial print applications as cloud printers on the Google Clound Print network.
<p></p>
Once I register a commercial cloud print on the network, then authenticate with a user using <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth.html" target="_blank">Google authentication and authorization APIs</a> the printer is ready for printing.  Print jobs availability is  then handled through <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/" target="_blank">Google Talk</a>, using a persistent XMPP connection.
<p></p>
I'm refreshing my memory on the <a href="http://xmpp.org/" target="_blank">XMPP standard</a> as well as researching four PHP XMPP classes:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/loudmouth-dev?pli=1" target="_blank">Loudmouth</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaxl/" target="_blank">jaxl</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/xmpphp/" target="_blank">xmpphp</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://bricabrac.origo.ethz.ch/wiki/Eiffel_XMPP" target="_blank">Eiffel XMPP</a></li>
</ul>
Although XMPP has its roots in communication its fascinatng to see the innovation around it into other areas of real-time programming such as <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/cloud-print/" target="_blank">cloud printing</a>.
<p></p>
Even though the core technology is stable, the XMPP community continues to define various XMPP extensions, ther is also an active community of open-source and commercial developers further pushing the boundaries of whats possible with XMPP.
