I am spending time evaluating and understanding the social footprint of conferences and events.  One event I am monitoring right now is the SXSW 2009 event. It is a great candidate because there is a alot of online and social activity around this show.<p></p>
I came across a blog post by Download Squad called unbagging of the Schwag. It really shows how your schwag and materials will get viewed or NOT viewed....<p></p>

Definitely should put thought into the merchandise and schwag you put forth as part of your exhibitors booth. Is it really getting used, read or given the attention you are looking for?
