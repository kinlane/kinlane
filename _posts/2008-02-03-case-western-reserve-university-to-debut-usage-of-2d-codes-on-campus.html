I was turned to an article about usage of <a href="http://2d-code.co.uk/qr-codes-on-campus/">QR Codes on Campus</a> over at <a href="http://2d-code.co.uk/">2d-code.co.uk</a>.<br />
<br />
Beginning February 1st 2008, students, faculty and staff at Case Western Reserve's Cleveland, Ohio, campus will be participating in the nation's first trial of "2D codes"�commonly referred to as "QR Codes"�by bringing the cell phone technology to campus.<br />
<br />
The 2D codes, first introduced on campus during fall orientation will be used as a link to mobile content in the form of pictures, music, videos, news articles and other interactive media.<br />
<br />
For companies, the codes present an avenue for extending the value of their product packaging. For students, the codes are a way to deliver information and entertainment to friends. For professors, they allow a new level of interactivity for engaging the Facebook generation.<br />
<br />
All faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends of the university who have a case.edu e-mail address can enroll in the pilot beginning February 1st at <a href="http://www.mobilediscovery.com/">http://www.mobilediscovery.com</a>.<br />
<br />
From this Web site, members of the university community will be able to download to a cell phone the software needed to read the codes, create their own 2D codes and connect the codes to content�for free. Some wireless carriers may charge users for each code read and content downloaded to the phone.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I get the feeling the educational institutions are behind the game when it comes to technology, it is nice to see some taking risks and leading.
