I was just reading a post while some files upload on Intacct which is an Accounting Ecosystem that groups together various accounting focused services together under one umbrella.<p></p>
It is interesting to see this type of aggregation at the SaaS layer of the cloud. I think this is something you will see more at the Software as a Service (SaasS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) , and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) levels of the cloud.<p></p>
The more you get quality service providers and developers doing one thing really well, there will be a need for a savvy business operations to come in and aggregate these offerings under a particular ecosystem or partner group and sell them together.<p></p>
It makes sense, and I think you will see this trend continue in different industries as the Cloud environment evolves. I think this will allow developers to do what they do best, create standards for services and interroperability.
