<p>I try to make sense of which companies are doing interesting things in the API space, and the interesting technologies that are done by these companies, that sometimes take on a life of their own. The thing I wrestle with with constantly, is how do you actually do this? The best tools in my toolbox currently are Twitter and Github. These two platforms provide me with a wealth of information about what is going on within a company, or specific project, the surrounding community, and the relationships they have developed (or not), along the way.</p>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been spending time, diving deeper into the Swagger community, and two key sources of information are the <a href="https://twitter.com/SwaggerApi">@swaggerapi Twitter account</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api">Swagger Github account</a>, with its 25+ repositories. Using each of these platform APIs, I can pull followers, favorites, and general activity for the Swagger community. Then I come up against the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swagger-swaggersocket">SwaggerSocket Google Group</a>. While there is a rich amount of information, and activity at the forum, with a lack of RSS or API, I can&rsquo;t make sense of the conversation at a macro level, alongside the other signals I&rsquo;m tracking on&mdash;grrrrrr.</p>
<p>At any time I can tune into the activity on Twitter, and Github for the Swagger community, but the Google Group takes much more work, and I have to go to the website to view, and manually engage. Ideally I could see Twitter, Github, and Google Group activity side by side, and make sense of the bigger picture. I can get email updates from the forum, but this applies from now forward, and gives me no context of history of the conversation within the group&mdash;without visiting the website.</p>
<p>Just a side rant from the day. This is not a critique of the Swagger community, just an outside view on the usage of Google Groups as an API community management tool. I use the platform for <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, but I think I might work on a better way to manage the community, one that allows outside entities to better track on the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
