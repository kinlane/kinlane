<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/amazon-s3-encryption.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Amazon Web Services <a title="now offers Server Side Encryption" href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2011/10/new-amazon-s3-server-side-encryption.html" target="_blank">now offers Server Side Encryption (SSE) for Amazon S3</a>, enablingthe ability to encrypt data stored in Amazon S3, by adding an additional request header when writing the object to Amazon S3, with decryptionoccurringautomatically when data is retrieved.
<p></p>
Amazon S3 Server Side Encryption employs multi-factor encryption, with each object encrypted with a unique key, and as an additional safeguard, this key is itself encrypted with a regularly rotated master key. Amazon S3 Server Side Encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available -- 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256).
<p></p>
You can start using Amazon S3 Server Side Encryption in the AWS Management Console:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Under the Amazon S3 tab, use the upload dialog to add files to be uploaded.</li>
	<li>In the Set Details section of the upload dialog, set the Use Server Side Encryption checkbox property.</li>
	<li>Start Upload. The files will be encrypted and stored in Amazon S3.</li>
</ol>
If you prefer to manage your own encryption keys, you can also make use of the client libraries for encryption provided by Amazon.
