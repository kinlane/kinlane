So recently I have installed 2 Adobe Air applications.  I installed <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">twhirl a twitter client </a>built on the Air platform, and now I just did <a href="http://blog.mootools.net/2008/3/15/snippely">Snippely a snippet code tool</a> from <a href="http://mootools.net/">MooTools</a>.<br /><br />I really like the install process which is very smooth and makes installing new apps so easy.<br /><br />I really like the application itself too.  They are very sexy, clean interfaces and lightweight.  They have all the functionality of a desktop application but seem like a browser web app as well.<br /><br />Interesting blend, would like to find time and play with developing Air apps myself.
