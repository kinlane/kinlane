I was just playing with <a href="http://cinch.blogtalkradio.com/">Cinch which is a new voice to RSS service</a>.  It allows you to call a number and it records a podcast for you.  It is more focused, but similar to the <a href="http://www.jott.com/">voice translation service Jott </a>that I have been using.<br /><br />It gives you an RSS feed of the calls you make which you can easily blend into a <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">Feedburner </a>tracking RSS feed.<br /><br />There is no limit to the recording unlike Jott, but of course it doesn't translate your calls.<br /><br />Another valuable audio and podcasting web 2.0 service.
