I love helping people learn about tools I take for granite. Things I know and use everyday.

I also enjoy people who are humble enough to ask for help and say they just don't know how to use something.<img class="alignnone" title="Windows Zip" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/zip_thumb.png" alt="" width="182" height="182" align="right" />

I recently got asked how to create and use zip files. Using zip files is an important tool in maximizing your time and drive space and sharing files with other users.
<p></p>
Zipping files allows you to package up many files into a single file. It is the equivalent of putting away your winter clothes into a bag and sucking all the air out of it. Then you save space or can travel with it. Then when ready you can unpack.
<p></p>
So I put together to demonstrations on how to package up many files into a single Zip file. Then what to do with zip files when you receive on.

</ul>
This demonstration assumes you are running windows which has a zip utility built into the windows explorer system.
