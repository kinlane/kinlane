<span style="font-family:georgia;">Great article in the Sunday Times Online called <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/career_and_jobs/recruiter_forum/article3255962.ece?Submitted=true">Learn to love social network sites</a>, it is about the widespread perspective of social networks and how allowing them to be used at work will contribute to employees wasting time and losing money for companies.<br /><br />It talks about how many companies have banned social networks all together for their workers, and how this can back-fire for many companies.<br /><br />It moves into talking about what benefit allowing employees to use social networks can bring for both internal and external operations.<br /><br />They even start diving a little into some Wikinomics and talk about crowdsourcing and other 2.0 concepts.<br /><br />Check it out, it is a good read.<br /></span>
