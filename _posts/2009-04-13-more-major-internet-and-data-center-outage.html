Was just reading this post about a <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/link/left-in-the-dark">major Australian Internet outage</a> that left the entire top end of the country without telephone, internet or mobile communications for about 10 hours.<p></p>
Definitely brings attention to a MAJOR problem we will continue facing with our nations infrastructure. I wrote about the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=514">outage in San Jose the other day</a>, that affected our company.<p></p>
There needs to be more auditing of our infrastructure and development of redundant fiber rings as well as make sure data center providers build in redundancy between data centers.
