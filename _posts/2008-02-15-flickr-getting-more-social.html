I haven't spent much time on Flickr until recently.  I have had an account for years, but only upload every once in a while.<br /><br />Tonight when I logged on to check out the mobile features I notice they are getting more social.  It asked me to complete my profile and upload a profile picture and tell a little more about myself.<br /><br />Didn't fill out much about myself, really get tired of putting information about myself.  Need a tool to do it automatically.
