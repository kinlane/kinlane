After I deal with all emails, fires, top requests, and spend a large amount of time on all my top projects I try to work on areas that are going to move my company forward.<p></p>
Creating a presence on the Internet is priority one. WebEvents Global is 10 years old, has a very mature software package, and handles some large events for prominent names such as SAP, Google, Schwab. However our web presence is non-existent. The event planning industry is a very incestual industry where most people know each other and most referrals are through word of mouth. We have done well with this methodology.<p></p>
Part of my role is to steer the company into the next generation of its development. So this involves bringing in the next generation of clientelle....this requires having a presence on the Internet and Social Media.<p></p>
So where do you start? A web site of course.....well we just got a newer version up. It isn't all it could be...but its a presence.<p></p>
So next steps are social networking profiles, a corporate blog and other online channels where we can share information about our company and the unique innovative way we conduct approach event management.<p></p>
More to come as I continue down this road...
