I have historically played around with many online marketing and social media marketing techniques. I play around from time to time to see what works and what doesn't.<br />
<br />
Last year I was walking around with my daughter and taking pictures for our Eugene Local Search web site. I am trying to have pictures of <a href="http://www.eugenelocalsearch.com/">local attractions and business around Eugene, Oregon</a>.<br />
<br />
I took this picture of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7687932@N02/449187995/">Eugene Federal Courthouse</a>. I then told a little story about it and happen to include a link <a href="http://www.originalwebsolutions.com/">Eugene Web Design Services</a> which links to our web development company.<br />
<br />
So it took a relevant geographical picture, some text, then linked with relevant keywords to our web site.<br />
<br />
I have noticed I still get a some click through on this link as well as some search engine optimization value.<br />
<br />
It is a nice example of using <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> as part of your <a href="http://www.oregonlocalsearch.com/">online marketing</a> and <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com/">social media marketing</a> strategy.
