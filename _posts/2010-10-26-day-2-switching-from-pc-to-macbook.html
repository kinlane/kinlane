It is now day two of being on my new Macbook Pro, and I am fine.  I haven't used an Mac computer since high school.  I am 38,  so 20 years?
<p></p>
I have been a PC user my entire adult likinlane-productions2on a Mac from time to time to troubleshoot something,  view a web site, or show my kids something (I bought them an IMac a few years back).  Other than that...I've spent thousands of hours on Windows workstations and servers.

My primary excuse for never switching to a Mac is that I need to support SQL Server.  I have used SQL Server since 1998.  That era is coming to an end.  Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful.  SQL Server has made me a lot of money and supported my family.  However, my career is moving on.  I will not be supporting SQL Server as a core job function anymore.  If I do any support I will log on to the server and work with via Remote Desktop (RDP).
<p></p>
This really isn't the reason Im switching though.  My primary reasons are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Battery Life:</strong> With all my traveling my 2-3 hours on PC is just unacceptable.</li>
	<li><strong>Play with Cool Kids: </strong> I'm going to be attending a lot of events and gatherings in Silicon Valley and I've seen the looks you get when you have a PC vs. Mac.</li>
	<li><strong>Change:</strong> Embracing of change, and encouraging it in all areas when I can.</li>
</ul>
I was immediately productive on my new MacBook Pro.  This was my main concern.  That somehow I would fumble around for days, and not be able to work at normal capacity.  This was not the case.  I haven't fumbled AT ALL.
<p></p>
The MacBook is intuitive, easy to use and I had all the applications I depend on up and running within an hour.
<p></p>
A contributing factor to the ease of transition is, I live in the clouds.  I use Gmail, Google Docs, Amazon Web Services, Evernote and many other cloud based tools.  I live in Google Chrome and Firefox.   I depend on many Software as a Service (SaaS) to get my work done.  So it really isn't about the platform anymore.  I just need a handful of installed apps, browsers, and an Internet connection.

I have to say I really love my MacBook.
