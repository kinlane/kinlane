I am working on my <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php" target="_blank">API Ecosystem</a> Strategy. First I started with the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/11/essentials-for-my-rest-print-api-area/" target="_blank">essentials for my Mimeo Connect REST Cloud Print area</a>.  These are the building blocks I must have to get my API open for business.<p></p>
I can't stop there, these are only the essentials.<p></p>
These building blocks only deliver what is needed to get access, learn about and get up and running using the REST Cloud Print API.  There is much more needed.<p></p>
I have assembled a set of phase two building blocks to help me market and support the API area:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Forum</li>
	<li>Blog</li>
	<li>Support Request Form</li>
	<li>Pricing / Rate Limits</li>
	<li>LinkedIn Profile</li>
	<li>Twitter Profile</li>
	<li>Facebook Page</li>
	<li>How Tos</li>
</ul>
Once that is up and running I will be in a good place to support a wide variety of partners and developers looking to integrate with the REST Cloud Print API.<p></p>
I can't stop there.  I need more tools to enhance the developer experience and begin showcasing the developers, partners and the application and tools they are producing.<p></p>
I have made a phase three list of building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Partner Showcase</li>
	<li>App Showcase</li>
	<li>Case Studies</li>
	<li>Tutorials</li>
	<li>Bug Ticket System</li>
	<li>FAQ</li>
	<li>Tour</li>
	<li>Ideas</li>
</ul>
These would round off the Mimeo API area and give me to the tools to start evolving it into a community around API access to <a href="http://my.mimeo.com" target="_blank">My Mimeo</a> and <a href="http://www.mimeo.com/solutions/mimeo-marketplace.php" target="_blank">Mimeo Marketplace</a>.<p></p>
Then I should be in a good place for 2011, to begin redefining print with the help of our community by merging traditional print and next generation of social, cloud and mobile technology.
