I am trying to find to find an appropriate solution for a friend that will allow him to manage a photo collection. Rather than build something from scratch I thought I'd take a look to see whats out there.<p></p>
I came across <a href="http://www.plogger.org/">Plogger</a>, a great <a href="http://www.plogger.org/">open-source web photo gallery</a>.<p></p>
It is an excellent example of quality FREE / Open Source software that has a single purpose and lives up to it.<p></p>
I just quickly downloaded and <a href="http://imagegallery.kinlane.com">installed it at a subdomain</a>. I was able to login and manage it quickly, simlilar to Wordpress.<p></p>
I would like to play with some cloud enhancements to it:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Allow easy install on an Amazon EC2 instance as a SaaS tool.</li>
	<li>Image storage on Amazon S3</li>
	<li>Flickr Integration</li>
	<li>Picasa Integration</li>
	<li>Flash Image Upload</li>
</ul>
Just some thoughts as I am playing with it. More to come as I learn more about it.
