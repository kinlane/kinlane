Just saw a commercial from Mountain Dew about their new soda creation web site, <a href="http://www.dewmocracy.com/">www.dewmocracy.com</a>.<br />
<br />
It was another interesting usage of Social Media Marketing that utilizes its pro-users or audience to facilitate research and development (R&amp;D). They are encouraging customers to go to the web site and help decide certain characteristics of a new Mountain Dew soda.<br />
<br />
It is a pretty simple web site surrounding a kind of game / soda creation application. The site is built in .NET, the application looks like Silverlight, but I am not sure.<br />
<br />
Not really impressed with the campaign overall but it is an interesting usage of these new methods.<br />
<br />
Shows that the big co's are embracing these principles, now we need to see more of it in the smaller business arena.
