I was just reading <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/03/04/myspace-developer-platform-jim-benedetto-myspace/" rel="bookmark">MySpace Developer Platform: Jim Benedetto, MySpace</a> on Jeremiah Owyang's blog. He is at the Social Graph Conference in San Diego. I wish I was there.<br />
<br />
Anyways he was posting a bunch of information about the MySpace development platform and it really shows an impressive approach on their part in reaching out to the developers community.<br />
<br />
Their approach is much better than Facebook.<br />
<br />
Yet we still give more priority to building Facebook apps and maintaing our presence there than we do on MySpace.<br />
<br />
It is primarily because of the demographics. It will be interesting to see who stays ahead in the Social Networking race.
