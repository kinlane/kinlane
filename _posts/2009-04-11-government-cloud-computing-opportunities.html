I am really blown away by some of the opportunities for cloud computing growth and adoption within the federal goverment right now. With all the recovery money out there, there is a lot of of projects that just need a little cloud perspective.
<p></p>I am seeing multiple database, server infrastructure, networking and application projects at the federal and state levels that just need some cloud savvy providers to come in and snatch up.
<p></p>Hopefully a lot of this recovery money "we" are spending can help fuel the growth and adoption of cloud computing.
