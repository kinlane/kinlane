<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.io/us-federal-budget/data/">As I was working my way through the data for the US federal budget</a>, I noticed a special row in between the years 1976 and 1977. It simply had the entry TQ, and no other information available about what it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get an answer regarding what this entry was, I went to my Twitter followers:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Anyone familiar with federal budget - <a href="https://t.co/FvJUrSTyFB">https://t.co/FvJUrSTyFB</a> - what happened in between 1976 and 77 - there is always a TQ row ?</p>

<p>Then, because I have the most amazing Twitter followers ever, got this response from Stephen H. Holden (@SteveHHolden):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> there was a transition quarter that year as a result of congressional action through reconciliation</p>

<p>When doing any open data work, you can't be afraid to just ask for help when you hit a wall. I've been doing data work for 25 years, and constantly hit walls when it comes to formatting, metadata, the data itself.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is use your Twitter followers, use your Facebook and LinkedIn followers, and make sure and publish questions as a Github issue--then always tell the story!</p>
