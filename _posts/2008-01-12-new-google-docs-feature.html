I have been using Google Notebook pretty heavily.  I use it for about 80% of my data gathering in combination with the Google Notebook Firefox Add-on.<br /><br />I have permanent and temporary Google Notebook Folders for different purposes.  I will export a notebook from a Google Notebook to Google Docs using the export feature available in the top right corner under tools.<br /><br />It really helps me internally publish gathered information to allow it to be more refined using Google Docs.  Also now I can collaborate with someone on the refinement.<br /><br /><span>A new Google Docs feature along the same lines that would be nice is:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taking an ordered list in Google Docs and highlighting and publish as a Google Presentation.</span><br /><br />I have created an ordered list in a Google Doc representing some topic, and I think...."This would make a nice presentation."<br /><br />It would be nice to highlight an ordered list and right clicking and be able to publish as Google Presentation.<br /><br />It would take each <> in the <> and make a slide with a caption of the text within the <><br /><br />Then I would save a great deal of time extending a Google Doc or a portion of the Google Doc as a Google Presentation.<br /><br />Just a thought on a new Google Feature, thanls for making it happen.
