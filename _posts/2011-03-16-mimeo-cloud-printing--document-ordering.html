<p></p>
When a user prints to a cloud printer, they will receive delivery options for their print order.   The Mimeo Cloud Printer returns a list of delivery options including delivery date(s) and shipping costs.
<p></p>
Once a delivery option is chosen, cloud printers return a full quote for the entire order containing all products and the shipping cost.
<p></p>
Mimeo Cloud Printers provide three options for handling payments:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Mimeo Account</strong> - All printing is billed through a specific Mimeo account.</li>
	<li><strong>Paypal</strong> - Integration with Paypal Basic or Paypal Advanced payments.</li>
	<li><strong>User Bill</strong> - Mimeo will collect billing information and bill print user directly.</li>
</ul>
Mimeo Cloud Printers enables commercial printing from major cloud storage platforms, building of print documents online, and ordering of documents built in the clouds.
