<p></p>A big part of this is also to update my <a title="Google Analytics to track social interactions" href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/gaTrackingSocial.html">Google Analytics to track social interactions</a> with <a title="kinlane.com" href="http://www.kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> and <a title="blog.apievangelist.com" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com">blog.apievangelist.com</a>.
<p></p>If you have set up both Google +1 and the latest version of Google Analytics on the same page, all +1 social interactions will be tracked automatically.
<p></p>To get social interaction tracking and reporting for other networks like Facebook or Twitter, you need to integrate Google Analytics tracking along with each network button.
<p></p>Using Google Analytics Social Tracking, you can record interactions range from a Facebook "Like" to a Twitter "Tweet." This allows me to view track on these social interactions along with other traffic to my blogs, in my Google Analytics dashboard.
<p></p>I added tracking for Facebook recommendations:
<p></p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/1066419.js?file=gistfile1.txt">
</script>Also added tracking for Facebook shares:<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/1066428.js?file=gistfile1.txt">
</script>
<p></p>Then I added tracking for tweets:
<p></p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1066430.js?file=gistfile1.txt" type="text/javascript">
</script>
<p></p>There were not ready to go scripts for tracking LinkedIn and StumbleUpon. I will be working on these as I can, so that I can track shares from my blogs to these social networking and bookmark sites.
