All right I have a couple of new Google Features for Google Docs tonight.  In addition to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Taking an ordered list in Google Docs and highlighting and publish as a Google Presentation</span><span>, I would like another one:<br /><br />I am working about 40+ documents in Google Docs right now.  I would like to share them all with someone and have them help me work on some and generally allow them to acess them.<br /><br />So what do I have to do?  I have to go through each Google Doc and share it with this contact.<br /><br />It would be much easier if I could just share them with a group.<br /><br /> <br /></span>
