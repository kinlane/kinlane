I was just going through my <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Google Webmaster Tools</a>, Google Analytics, and Feedburner stats. I noticed in my <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Google Webmaster Tools</a> that I come up number 7 in Google Search for <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?cat=221">Enterprise 2.0</a>. So I went to Google and typed it in.<p></p>
Sure enough I'm number 5 for <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?cat=221">Enterprise 2.0</a>. I even beat out the <a href="http://andrewmcafee.org/blog/">Andrew McAfee's Blog</a>, and he is the godfather of Enterprise 2.0.<p></p>
I don't consider myself an expert in <a href="http://andrewmcafee.org/blog/">Enterprise 2.0</a>, but I think many of the topics I research and discuss are extremely relevant to enterprise. And since I do manage event technology for SAP and Google, that I am going to come up relevant.<p></p>
Not sure how long it will last, but its very cool.
