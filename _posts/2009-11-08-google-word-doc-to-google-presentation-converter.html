Here is a tool / idea that I came up with out of necessity. Like many of my ideas I probably will never get time to actually do it. So I am putting it out there to the universe and hopefully someone will do.<p></p>
I am building an outline using <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Docs" rel="homepage" href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>. This outline is my detailed breakdown of a web application. I am getting close to having outline finished.
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" align="right">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img title="Image representing Google Docs as depicted in ..." src="http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0001/2881/12881v6-max-450x450.png" alt="Image representing Google Docs as depicted in ..." width="122" height="30" align="right" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
Now I would like to take this outline and quickly build a Google Presentation from it.<p></p>
It shouldn't be too difficult to do using the Google Docs API. You could just break on the different &lt;ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;li&gt; items in the document and quickly give a visual interface for determining where you'd like the slides to breakdown.<p></p>
Then I could just jump into each slide and create a visual and / or narrative to complete.<p></p>
Google or someone other savvy developer could you get on this for me? Until then I will just have to copy / paste my outline into different slides. :(
