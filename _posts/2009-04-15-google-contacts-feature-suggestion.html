I have had my Gmail account since the early days. I begged people to give me invites and finally got one. Ohhhh the early days. So my contact list is pretty large, and now that Google has expanded it beyond just a list of email addresses into an actual contact management system.<p></p>
It is pretty simple, but you can actually do a lot with it.<p></p>
I have been working to clean up my contact system and really start using it as a CRM. I really like that I can see the conversation history of people and remember who they are sometimes.<p></p>
I would like to suggest a really simple notes feature in the Google Contacts. So when someone emails me I can put more context into the relationship beyond actual emails, texts, or chats that I've had with that person.<p></p>
Just a suggestion Google, some notes please in Google Contacts.<p></p>
