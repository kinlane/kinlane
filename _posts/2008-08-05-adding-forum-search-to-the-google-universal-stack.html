I was doing some research tonight for a new social media marketing campaign tonight....I perform due diligence on a topic by running through the Google Search Toolbar...web,images, video and blogs.<br /><br />Then I jump over to use <a href="http://www.boardtracker.com/">BoardTracker</a> and <a href="http://boardreader.com/">BoardReader</a> to search through forums on different topics.<br /><br />I think Google should go ahead and purchase one of these forum search engines and add it to their universal search stack.
