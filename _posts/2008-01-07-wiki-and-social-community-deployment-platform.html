I was just playing around with <a href="http://wiki.mindtouch.com">Deki Wiki</a> a free open source wiki and application platform for deploying enterprise scale applications.<br /><br />I was blown away with the functionality of this.  It has all the great Wiki characteristics, however it goes a step further and truly is an application deployment platform.<br /><br />It shares some common characteristics with my Original Web Solutions Network Platform.  They embraced a web services architecture just like I did as well as utilize Amazon S3 for core storage needs.<br /><br />They built the business layer using PHP and the Web Services data layer using Microsoft C#.   It can be deployed on a Windows or Linux platform.<br /><br />It is truly a sweet application and I hope to get the chance to deploy one soon.
