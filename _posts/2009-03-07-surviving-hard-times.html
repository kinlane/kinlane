I have been noticing more and more web services either going down or having severe latency because they are overloaded.

Obviously it is hard to stay afloat during this hard time.   Another reason to advocate for building JavaScript application.   

You can build a JavaScript application that utilizes RSS feeds from 3rd party sources as well as make your data source be GData.  Then you can scale and store data on another persons dime.

Or if you want to deploy in a scalable environment that you pay for as you go check out Amazon AWS....then if you get the response and traffic....at least it will scale and be low cost.
