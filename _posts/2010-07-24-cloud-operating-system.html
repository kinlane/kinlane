<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Cloud Operating System" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-operating-system.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I thoroughly enjoy my career right now. It is exciting being part of where technology and computing is going right now. I'm a total cloud computing fanboy, I admit. I do try to keep it realistic and focused on how it influences business and IT operations.
<p></p>
Right now I can really see "cloud computing" or the "cloud operating system" really coming together. Last week <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/07/openstack-open-source-open-standards-cloud/">Rackspace released their core cloud computing stack and created the OpenStack</a>, which is focused on two important elements of the cloud OS:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Compute</li>
	<li>Storage</li>
</ul>
These are the essential building blocks for the entire cloud operating system. I see all the other elements coming together as well:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Virtual Desktops</li>
	<li>Cloud Office Applications</li>
	<li>Communications with Email, Chat, and VOIP</li>
	<li>Music</li>
	<li>Video / Media</li>
	<li>Images / Pictures</li>
	<li>Print</li>
</ul>
We just need to work on the delivery and interoperability. My laptop, Iphone, Blackberry, Android and IPad should all see the the same cloud operating system profile. Depending on the interface I will have different aspects of my operating system available to me.
<p></p>
I should be able to listen to my music, management my documents, and print at home or office regardless of what machine I'm on. Its my operating system in the clouds.
