<p></p>
I see the the cloud computing naysayers stepping up with, "SEE, don't get too dependent on the cloud!"
<p></p>
It reminds me of a company I worked at once, where after 48 hours of Microsoft Exchange server being down, IT held a meeting and said everyone's email accounts were removed and there were no backups.
<p></p>
Everyone gets to start fresh with their email account!!
<p></p>
The Gmail loss of emails reminds me....get dependent on whoever you want. Gmail, Microsoft or your companies IT.

Just make sure you have a good quality backup process for ANY service you depend on.
