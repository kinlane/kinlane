<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Cookie Monster" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/cookie-monster.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Cookies store information about us and our surfing habits (and they are yummy). One of the secure things about a cookie is that you can only access it within the web site to which the cookie belongs.
<p></p>
So if you are visiting <a href="http://www.kinlane.com">www.kinlane.com</a> I can put a cookie on your computer, but only I can access it. I own the domain <a href="http://www.kinlane.com">www.kinlane.com</a>

I just watched a movie on a famous band on <a href="http://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank">Netflix</a>. After watching I went to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a> to look up more videos on this band.
<p></p>
Before I could watch my video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>, I had to watch an advertisement trying to sell me <a href="http://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank">Netflix</a>.
<p></p>
It seems like we should have a "header" or part of a cookie that any domain can read. So youtube.com could query netflix.com on my computer and see if I'm a Netflix member, or at the very least see I just came from Netflix.
<p></p>
Just a thought.
