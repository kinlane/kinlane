I was reading a blog about a new service that will scan your business cards and import into a database for you. Here is their pitch: CloudContacts takes your business cards and puts them to work for you. Instead of storing your business cards in a pile on your desk or in one physical location, CloudContacts allows you to access your contacts at any time. You can import your business cards into many email applications and connect on most business social networks. Connect your contacts today with CloudContacts! Pretty interesting service for busy people.
