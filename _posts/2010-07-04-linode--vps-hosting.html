<p></p>
I just stumbled across this company, yet they are a 7 year old "cloud" platform with an pretty impressive set of features out of the box:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Multiple Linux distributions</li>
	<li>Create Configuration Profiles which associate disk images and device nodes</li>
	<li>Boot between configuration profiles</li>
	<li>Share disk images between configuration profiles</li>
	<li>Resize disk images</li>
	<li>Network and CPU usage graphs</li>
	<li>Multiple IP address support</li>
	<li>Managed/hosted DNS service with slave support</li>
	<li>Custom reverse DNS (rdns)</li>
	<li>Access Out of band console access using Lish</li>
	<li>Lish menu system to issue jobs to your Linode</li>
	<li>Lish access via SSH keys</li>
	<li>Support for booting into single user mode, init=/bin/bash</li>
	<li>Support for booting with a custom "root=" kernel parameter</li>
	<li>Support for booting with an initrd</li>
	<li>Bootable recovery distribution (Finnix)</li>
	<li>Add and remove extra resources to and from your Linode</li>
	<li>Shutdown Watchdog will automatically reboot your Linode in case of a crash</li>
	<li>Clone a Linode to another</li>
	<li>Move IPs from one Linode to another</li>
	<li>IP address fail over support for high availability setups</li>
</ul>
To make them even more competitive they provide data centers in:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>London, GB, UK</li>
	<li>Newark, NJ, USA</li>
	<li>Atlanta, GA, USA</li>
	<li>Dallas, TX, USA</li>
	<li>Fremont, CA, USA</li>
</ul>
They look like a pretty scrappy cloud service provider offering computing and storage services. In the <a href="http://www.jackofallclouds.com" target="_blank">Jack of all Clouds</a>, <a href="http://www.jackofallclouds.com/2010/07/state-of-the-cloud-july-2010/" target="_blank">State of the Cloud</a> report they show them as being one of the fastest growing <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/cloud-service-providers/">cloud service providers</a>.
<p></p>
With their pricing model, simple dashboard, and straightforward approach, they look like a sensible small business solution for migrating to the cloud.
