I am seeing Twitter used as a tool for measuring the buzz around an event or topic. It definitely has become an effective way for measuring the number of people talking about a topic and the tone of that conversation.<p></p>
It also allows you to dive into the detail of what people are saying and get some valuable feedback from your potential customers and fanbase.
