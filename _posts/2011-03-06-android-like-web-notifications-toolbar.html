<img src="http://www.webmonkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/w3c_main-300x45.png" alt="" align="right" />I just had a new idea for a startup. I'm in love with everything about technology startups except actually starting another one myself.<p></p>
So I kind of work the opposite of the rest of Silicon Valley, when I have an idea I just put it out there on the open Internet.<p></p>
I'm reading <a title="Web Notifications API" href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/03/web-notifications-api-hints-at-a-brave-new-real-time-web/">Scott's analysis of theWeb Notifications API</a> over at <a title="Webmonkey" href="http://www.webmonkey.com">webmonkey</a>.<p></p>
I like my <a title="Gmail Web Notifications" href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/desktop-notifications-for-emails-and.html">Google Gmail notifications</a>. I also like the way Android does mobile notifications.  So does <a title="Fred Wilson" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/03/mobile-notifications.html">Fred Wilson</a>.<p></p>
Somebodyneeds to do a Software as a Service (SaaS) startup dedicated to simplifying webnotifications.<p></p>
Make it plug and play for other app developers and web site owners to implement web notifications, similar to what <a title="Janrain OpenID" href="http://www.janrain.com/janrain-products-overview">Janrain has done for OpenID</a>.<p></p>
Allow users to get a web notification toolbar at the top of their browser, something like the new <a title="Wordpress Admin Bar" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-admin-bar/">Wordpress admin bar</a>, to receive web updates from all their accounts.<p></p>
It would be in their browser on their laptop, mobile phone, and tablets.<p></p>
Keep it simple, <a title="Do One Thing Well" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/10/instagram-doing-one-thing-well/">do one thing well</a>, stay in tune with where each browser is going with their support for the <a title="Web Notifications API" href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebNotifications/publish/">Web Notifications API</a>, and I'm sure someone will invest in you.<p></p>
Maybe <a title="Union Square Ventures" href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures</a>? Fred believes <em>"<a title="Mobile Notifications" href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/03/mobile-notifications.html">mobile notifications are one of the biggest game changers to come along in our world recently</a>"</em>.<p></p>
