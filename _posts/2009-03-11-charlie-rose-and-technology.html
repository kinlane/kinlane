I am really impressed with the Charlie Rose show lately. I have always enjoyed his show and his lineup of guests.<p></p>
However in the last year his lineup of technology leaders and visionary is impressive.<p></p>
What is even more impressive is his ability to know whats going on. He doesn't just have a list of quality questions. He actually knows what he is asking. He gets it.<p></p>
He claims he's not a super savvy tech person but he comes off like he is. Someof the most notable interviews lately are:
<ul class="mainlist">

There are a few more I can't recall right now, and of course he has many other amazing non-techy guests.
