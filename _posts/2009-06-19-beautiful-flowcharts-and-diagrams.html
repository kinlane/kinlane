I always want to visual my projects and ideas in easy to understand <a class="zem_slink" title="Diagram" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram">diagrams</a> that are beautiful. I always look to <a href="http://hinchcliffeandcompany.com/">Dion Hinchcliffe</a> as the <a href="http://hinchcliffeandcompany.com/">master of technical diagrams</a>. I love his work.<p></p>
Being able to take a complex idea and articulate it in a single visual diagram that is universally understood is gold.<p></p>
So I want to get over my hump of creating very dull and boring diagrams using Microsoft Visio or other basic tool.<p></p>
I am research a couple of tools:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniplan/download/">Omniplan</a> - A slick visual planning tool.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle </a>- A slick diagramming tool by the crew that made Omniplan.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.lovelycharts.com/index.php?page=gallery&amp;category=networks">Lovely Charts</a> - The names says it all.</li>
</ul>
That is all for now...will keep looking and see what else I find.
