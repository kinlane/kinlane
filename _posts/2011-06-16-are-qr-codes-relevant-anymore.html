<p></p>
QR Codes have been around since 1994, and every couple years seem to get heralded as the next big thing.
<p></p>
QR Codes can be used to link the offline world, with online information, with single scan or snap of a picture.  QR codes can contain links that take users to a web page.  If a user sees a barcode on a store-front window, or on a flyer on telephone pole, they can can snap a picture using their phone and be routed to a web page.

Sounds pretty cool eh?

It does seem like it can be used for an infinite number of things.  But QR codes seem a little irrelevevant in a time of image recognition and technology like <a title="Google Googles" href="http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/#text">Google Googles</a>.
<p></p>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-goggles.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />Google Goggles is an image recognition application created by Google, which is used for searches based on images captured with your camera phone or handheld device.

You can take a picture of a bottle of wine and it will tell you what kind of wine it is, and search for it.  You can take a picture of a famous landmark and it will recognize it, and conduct a search for you.
<p></p>
So with image recognition software and applications like Google Googles, are those black and white QR codes even still relevant?
<p></p>
I saw an advertisement for a band the other day, the poster had a little QR code in the corner.  I took a picture of the CD image on the poster, and Google Googles named the band, did a search and I was at the site.
<p></p>
So if I can get there with taking pictures of every day objects, why do I need QR codes?  Seems like something brands should consider.
