Amazon just added another quality web service to their killer lineup.  They released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_1?ie=UTF8&amp;node=342429011&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">Amazon DevPay</a> in Limited Beta, which is a simple-to-use billing and account service that assists developers in getting paid for applications they build using Amazon Web Services.<br /><br />Its a layer built on their Flexible Payment Services and allows me to integrate it into applications I build and allows me to create and manage the billing system for the application.<br /><br />I allows me to take advantage of various payment setups such as recurring and usage-based pricing models.<br /><br />Interesting addition....I still haven't completely grasped how SimpleDB is going to be worked into my architecture.  Lots to do!
