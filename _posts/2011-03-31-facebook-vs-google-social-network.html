I see a lot of speculation and talk about Google's social efforts compared to Facebook.
<p></p>
Facebook is definitely a dominant player in this game, and everyone keeps waiting for a clear social move from Google.

The defining characteristic between these two players is Facebook is building a social network within a walled garden.

Facebook launches features and tools for bringing sites, content and users into this walled garden.
<p></p>
Google operates on the open Internet. Building a social network on the open Internet is a lot tougher, than a walled garden.
<p></p>
I think Google's social network is so big, and rolling out incremently that most users can't even see it. Its that big.
<p></p>
Google has all the key social networkcomponents, but they are open and more distributed, making difficult for pundits to see.

I think in the long run Google will dominate over Facebook, by playing the game more open and building out using Internet standards, where Facebook's walled garden will become isolated.
