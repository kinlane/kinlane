<p></p>As an evangelist for a print API, I often get asked, What are you doing working in a dying industry?
<p></p>I don't see the print industry as dying, I see it as evolving. I often say that the largest and loudest sectors of print are making a lot of noise, and have trouble adjusting.
<p></p>I see the <a title="Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API" href="../../">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API</a> as my opportunity help re-invent the print industry.
<p></p>I pay attention to how APIs transform many different industries, an example of this is the telephone directory business.
<p></p>I've had discussions with <a href="http://www.ypg.com/en/">Yellow Pages Group (YPG)</a> from Canda, and I'm monitoring their work to evolve their business from print phone books to local search and location based service provider using their API.
<p></p>YPG has successfully transformed their dying print based business using the Internet and its <a href="http://www.yellowapi.com/">YellowAPI.com</a> community.
<p></p>YellowAPI.com allows developers to build local search and location based applications using the wealth of data provided by the Yellow Pages Group network of partners.
<p></p>API developers extend the reach of the network and its partners creating a ecosystem that can constantly innovate and grow.
<p></p>YPG has provided additional incentive for developers by providing innovative ways for them to monetize their applications in the form of widgets, product placement, group deals, and advertising.
<p></p>Using the Internet, an innovative API strategy, and a clear monetization vision, the Yellow Pages Group has re-invented themselves from a dying print based company into a successful Web 2.0 company.
