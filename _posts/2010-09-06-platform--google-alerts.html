<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Google Alerts" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-alerts.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I spend time each week to define the technology platform I use to accomplish business. One of the goals of this <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/platform/">platform definition</a> is to assist in my migration to the cloud.
<p></p>
I realized another tool I use daily, but have overlooked. I use <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts" target="_blank">Google Alerts</a> to discover new information on blogs, search, and other discussions.
<p></p>
I follow the these key phrases / topics currently:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Amazon Web Services</li>
	<li>Amazon EC2</li>
	<li>Amazon S3</li>
	<li>Application Programming Interface</li>
	<li>API</li>
	<li>Cloud Computing</li>
	<li>HTML5</li>
	<li>HTML5 localstorage</li>
</ul>
In addition to Google Reader and Twitter I use these daily Google Alerts to discover new sites, topics, and trends in my industry. I depend on these to keep me ahead of the curve when it comes to technology that is important to me.
<p></p>
I also use <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts" target="_blank">Google Alerts</a> to track the most important key phrase in my world....."<strong>Kin Lane</strong>". Yes I am vain.
