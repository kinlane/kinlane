I was reading <a href="http://lifehacker.com/339206/get-live-firefox-chat-support-from-mozilla">Get Live Firefox Chat Support from Mozilla over at LifeHacker</a> and it reminded me of one of my application ideas from my notebook.<br /><br />They are offering live Firefox chat support now using an all volunteer support staff.  They are just passionate Firefox users willing to lend a hand.<br /><br />I had made this recommendation for a client back a few months ago to offer this in the venture capital and business planning industries.  <br /><br />Live chat support for any product or product line seems like a good solution that could be offered in many industries in a sort of open source kind of way. <br /><br />Would take the right company to be open enough to partner with their "prosumers" or other heavy players that way.  But definitely a cheap way to run a real clean, honest support program.
