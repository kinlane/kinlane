<p></p>
Now you can host your domains DNS with Amazon for $1.00 / month per zone and .50 cents per million queries.
<p></p>
You can use the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/" target="_blank">Route 53 DNS</a> for your Amazon infrastructure as well manage external resources as well.
<p></p>
For my personal domains I tend to use the DNS that comes with the domain at GoDaddy. I have setup DNS services using Amazon EC2 instances, and now can stop doing this and rely on their new <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/" target="_blank">Route 53 DNS</a> service.
