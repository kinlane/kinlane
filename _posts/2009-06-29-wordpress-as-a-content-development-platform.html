I have been using wordpress installations for <a class="zem_slink" title="Content development (web)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_development_%28web%29">content development</a>. I am working on a couple of books and whitepapers.
<p></p>The <a class="zem_slink" title="White paper" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper">white papers</a> should be much shorter than the books. However the platform seems to work with my way of evolving the content for these papers and books.
<p></p>Even one book I am making public as I am writing it. Just because it is a hobby project. I like the blog format because it organizes things by date as I write them. I can also categorize them.
<p></p>Then I can write more linear pages and pull together the different areas. I also like the linking in between topics and pulling together. I really makes a non linear book.
<p></p>We'll see where I go with this content development.
