I was driving home tonight from Eugene....it was a real quiet drive.<p></p>
About half way home I decided to turn on the radio.<p></p>
At first it all sounded like clutter and noise, not music.<p></p>
Then once my senses adjusted I was able to tell it was music.<p></p>
I was about to shut it off.<p></p>
I wonder how much else I shut off before I recognize its music.
