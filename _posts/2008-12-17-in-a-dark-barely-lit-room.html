In a dark, barely lit room
Monday night maestro
Twice nightly in Birmingham
Sold in cardboard boxes
Minimum drink purchase required
Gold flakes by the fire
Hand crafted using renewable energy
And we say Na Na Na Na Na
Hard and twisted wrought iron
Cannot get through the mesh
Yet we can feel the heat.
Not much to be said.
So much to be written
I am writing so fast
I am not even stopping
To read my writing
