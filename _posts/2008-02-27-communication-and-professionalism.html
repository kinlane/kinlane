I am reviewing about 8 resumes that were submitted for a social media marketing consultant.  I made sure that when the resumes came in I responded to each letting them know I received and were reviewing. <br /><br />Once I reviewed them all and was in the process of presenting them to the client I emailed each one personally and let them know where I was in the process.<br /><br />One of the applicants emailed me saying how he appreciated the communication. <br /><br />Made me think some more about this.  I have experienced that a lot.  In my last job search I submitted probably 150 resumes and received responses from about 20.....and interviews for about 15. <br /><br />Most you never hear from.  It isn't hard to drop them all into an email folder and export the email list and run a mail merge or god forbid actually personally respond.<br /><br />So just wanted to share those thoughts.  I am not always the best at communicating, I am the first to admit.  However we can all try to be better at it.<br /><br />Might come back to us at the right moment.
