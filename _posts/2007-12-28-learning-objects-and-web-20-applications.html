I have been spending a great deal of time learning about "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Object">learning objects</a>" from a site called <a href="http://www.merlot.org/">Merlot</a>.   <br /><br />Wikepedia defines a learning object as:<ul class="mainlist"><li>"Any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training"</li><li>"Any digital resource that can be reused to support learning"</li><li>"Web-based interactive chunks of e-learning designed to explain a stand-alone learning objective"</li><li>"A digitized entity which can be used, reused or referenced during technology supported learning"</li><li>"A digital, self-contained, reusable entity with a clear learning aim that contains at least three internal changing and editable components: content, instructional activities (learning activities), and context elements. As a complement, the learning object should have an external component of information which helps its identification, storage, and recovery: the metadata."</li></ul>I would like to see any web 2.0 application have a learning object defined for it just like we reference an RSS feed or other media link for a site today. <br /><br />If it is a web application that is fairly complex or even simple it should have at least a basic set of learning objects for it that the average user can use to learn more about the application or a teacher can use to integrate into their classroom curriculum.<br /><br />This is something I would like to work more on as part of the <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com">Social Media Squad</a> and meeting its mission of <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com">Translating 2.0 to the Real World</a>.
