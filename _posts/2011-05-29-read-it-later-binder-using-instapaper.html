It allows bookmarking of web pages, blog posts and any web or mobile content. Once bookmarked the content is available for reading on Instapaper web site and mobile.

<span>Instapaper enables users to save web content using browser bookmarklets, IPhone or IPad App, Email, and is available in a long list of other web and mobile applications.</span>

Instpaper does one thing, and does it very well: Save content for reading it later.kinlane-productions2
<p></p>
I personally use Instapaper for reading long form content like whitepapers, articles, and blog posts on my IPad or Android tablet.  I bookmark content through the week and come the weekend I can read at my leisure away from the computer. It becomes my replacement for the Sunday edition of the paper.
<p></p>
Not all users have made the transition to digital consumption of their content, and are still used to reading in a print format.

<a title="Mimeo Connect REST API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/mimeo_connect_logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>I would like to see a developer build an application that would pull a users list of active posts to Instapaper every Thursday night (or other schedule) and push to <a title="Mimeo Connect REST API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect REST API</a> for printing in a binder. The user would receive their binder by Friday at end of business and could consume over the weekend.
<p></p>
This tool could be used beyond just weekly reading and allow other one or many users to aggregate content from various sources using Instapaper, then publish in a binder for a target audience to consume.
<p></p>
With its simple web interface, mobile applications, integrations into  other applications, and an API it makes perfect tool for publishers to  use as a content aggregation tool.
