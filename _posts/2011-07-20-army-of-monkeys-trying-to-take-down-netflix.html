Since no single component in the cloud can guarantee 100% up-time, Netflix has to design a cloud architecture where individual components can fail without affecting the availability of the entire system.
<p></p>
To do this, Netflix uses techniques like graceful degradation on dependency failures, as well as node-, rack-, datacenter/availability-zone and even regionally-redundant deployments. However, designing a fault tolerant architecture is not enough, they have to be able to regularly test and know if they can survive any outage.
<p></p>
So <a title="Netflix built chaos monkey" href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2010/12/5-lessons-weve-learned-using-aws.html">Netflix built Chaos Monkey</a>, a tool that randomly disables their production instances, to make sure Netflix can survive this common type of failure without any customer impact. Neflix runs this during regular business hours in a very controlled way, to learn about how their network responds, as they work to make it more resilient.
<p></p>
Inspired by the success of the Chaos Monkey, they've started creating a whole new line of simians that induce various kinds of failures, or detect abnormal conditions, and test our ability to survive them:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Latency Monkey</strong> - Induces artificial delays in the NEtflix RESTful client-server communication layer to simulate service degradation.</li>
	<li><strong>Conformity Monkey</strong> - Discovers instances that don't adhere to best-practices and shuts them down.</li>
	<li><strong>Doctor Monkey</strong> - Taps into health checks that run on each instance as well as monitors other external signs of health to detect unhealthy instances.</li>
	<li><strong>Janitor Monkey</strong> - Ensures that the Netflix cloud environment is running free of clutter and waste, by searching for unused resources and disposing of them.</li>
	<li><strong>Security Monkey</strong> - An extension of Conformity Monkey. It finds security violations or vulnerabilities, such as improperly configured AWS security groups, and terminates the offending instances.</li>
	<li><strong>10-18 Monkey</strong> - Detects configuration and run time problems in instances serving customers in multiple geographic regions, using different languages and character sets.</li>
	<li><strong>Chaos Gorilla -</strong> Similar to Chaos Monkey, but simulates an outage of an entire Amazon availability zone.</li>
</ul>
As Netflix grows at an unprecendented pace, testing for all types of failure scenarios will be anever-endingjob. They are in some seriously uncharted territory, with the number of instances they run and bandwidth they consume, while running completely in the Amazon cloud.
<p></p>
The Netflix simian army can be a model for cloud fault tolerance, that the rest of us can learn from. Let's just hope the Netflix simian army never develops a mind of its and comes after the rest of us.
