I'm enjoying learning about HTML 5.  I haven't been this excited about HTML since 1995(well maybe the day I actually understood the DOM also).  I recently played around with the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/html-5/html5-web-storage/">HTML5 Local Web Storage</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/html-5/html5-web-sql-database/">HTML5 Web SQL Database</a> in a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/06/html-5-web-sql-database/">HTML local contact management prototype</a> I am building.<p></p>
As I'm learning about the other features of HTML5 I will document the best learning tools here:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.focus.com/images/view/11905/"><strong>HTML Info Graphic</strong></a> - An excellent visual walking you through HTML 5.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/">Dive Into HTML 5</a></strong> - A regular novel on HTML 5. Still working through this one.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.dave-woods.co.uk/index.php/html5-tutorial-getting-started/">HTML5 Tutorial</a></strong> - Getting Started - This covers the basics of an HTML 5 document.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/previewofhtml5">A Preview of HTML 5</a></strong> - Walks through the HTML document, video and audio, and document representation.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/semantics.html">What Does It All Mean?</a></strong> - This one really dives in deep to the HTML 5 document and the semantics of HTML 5. I will be reading this one over and over.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://html5demos.com/">HTML 5 Demos and Examples</a> </strong>- Some great functional introductions to HTML 5. I like it because it included functional HTML5 as well as the visual eye candy.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://paperkilledrock.com/2010/05/html5-localstorage-part-one/">HTML 5 Local Storage</a></strong> - Diving more into the functional. Which I like.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2009/02/html5-canvas-cheat-sheet.html">HTML 5 Canvas Cheat Sheet</a> </strong>- Cheat sheets are always handy.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/24192622/HTML5-Visual-Cheat-Sheet-Reloaded">HTML 5 Cheat Sheet</a></strong> - A cheat sheet for the wall.</li>
</ul>
As with the number of programming languages I've learned over the years, I don't learn fully until I get actual projects under my belt. I'm focused on learning the functional sides of HTML 5 before I dive into the visual eye candy. I will keep working on my HTML local storage prototypes. Although I know Audrey will want a player for our music stored on the Amazon S3 cloud before much longer.
