Why don't I get some sort of traffic statistics for my Facebook profile? You get reporting if you buy advertising.<p></p>
I would like to see statistics for my page views, image, video and links.<p></p>
I should be able to see how many people are viewing my profile.<p></p>
Maybe you shouldn't show "who" is visiting...but I would at least some sort of Google Analytics for it.
