Was able to find a couple hours today to read everything in my inbox regarding my <a class="zem_slink" title="Cloud Computing" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Cloud_Computing">cloud computing</a> research. Thanks for those of you who responded and are getting involved.
<p></p>It was a busy week for me preparing for the <a class="zem_slink" title="SAP AG" rel="homepage" href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP</a> Sapphire event in <a class="zem_slink" title="Orlando, Florida" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=28.5436111111,-81.3727777778&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=28.5436111111,-81.3727777778%20%28Orlando%2C%20Florida%29&amp;t=h">Orlando</a> in May (and will be more very busy weeks to come until everything is done 5/15).
<p></p>So I won't have much time for me extracurriculur learning and research.
<p></p>I did make it through my inbox, but only part of my RSS Feeds. I got some good thoughts out and bookmarked my next round of research that I will be posting to my <a href="http://cloud.kinlane.com">cloud computing research site</a>. So stay tuned.
