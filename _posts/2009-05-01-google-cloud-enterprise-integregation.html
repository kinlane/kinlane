Google continued maturing their cloud offerings for the enterprise world yesterday with a <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/04/sync-google-apps-user-accounts-with.html"><span class="zem_slink">Google Apps</span> <span class="zem_slink">LDAP</span></a> <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/04/sync-google-apps-user-accounts-with.html">integration tool</a>.<p></p>
Google Apps Directory Sync now lets businesses and schools with an LDAP user directory system transition more quickly and smoothly to Google Apps. Instead of manually maintaining a separate user account directory in Google Apps, this utility lets Google Apps tap into an existing repository of user account information.<p></p>
Google's cloud is definitely maturing and making major leaps forward to allow for enterprise adoption of the Google Cloud. I have talked about the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=571">Google Secure Data Connector</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=511">Google Data Visualization</a>, and the overall approach Google seems to be making in regards to a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=626">complete cloud platform in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS areas</a>.<p></p>
I enjoy seeing more of the pieces coming together for the Google Cloud Platform.
