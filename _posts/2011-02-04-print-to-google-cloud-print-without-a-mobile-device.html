It is an amazing platfor, however one complaint I have is that it currently supports printing only through iPhone, IPad and Android devices.
<p></p>
So I started looking and I found a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ffaifmgpcdjedlffbhenaloimajbdkfg?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Chrome extension that will let you print documents from your regular desktop or laptop browser</a>.
<p></p>
Using the extension, you will see an icon in your address bar when you are vewing a PDF or Word document in a Google Chrome browser.
<p></p>
You can click the icon and print the document using the cloud printers you have registered with your Google Cloud Print service.
<p></p>
I will spend some more time and see if I can find asimilaradd-on for IE or Firefox browsers.
