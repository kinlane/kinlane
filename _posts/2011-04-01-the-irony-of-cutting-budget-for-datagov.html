I refuse to align myself with any political party. When I vote for president its always a vote for the lesser of two evils. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/government/data_gov.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /> My republican friends probably think I'm a liberal, my liberal friends probably think I'm aconservative.
<p></p>I'm pretty middle of the road.
<p></p>Even though I'm completely pissed off about <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/03/31/budget-technopocalypse-deepens-transparency-sites-will-go-dark-in-a-few-months/">todaysannouncementsthat Data.gov,USASpending.gov and other government data sites will go dark because of spending cuts</a>....I can't help but see the irony.
<p></p>Republicans are on a spending cut rampage! Fight big government! Cut waste!!
<p></p>Democrats are just a bunch of pussies when it comes to cutting any real spending or increasing revenue by taxing the rich.
<p></p>To me cutting programs that create transparency in government and hold politicians accountable for their spending, is the ultimate in irony.
<p></p>It shows thehypocrisyof both Democrats and Republicans. Neither want transparency, because it shows them for what they are.
<p></p>Very sad day...
