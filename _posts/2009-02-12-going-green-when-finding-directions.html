So I just did it....I was googling an address of a table I"m buying off craigslist. I typed the address into <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Maps" rel="homepage" href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> and it already had my home address.<p></p>
Clicked submit.....<p></p>
Saw the directions to my location...very nice.<p></p>
Noticed the Also Available: Public Transit option above my directions. Very cool...if I had more time. (nice excuse buddy) Next time though. Right.<p></p>
Went to print out my directions and saw the Go Green banner ad at the top. Telling me to download maps onto my handheld.<p></p>
Then I look over 6 inches and see my 2 blackberries.<p></p>
I guess it's just the moment it actually clicked....I've gotten directions on my blackberry before. I do it all the time.<p></p>
But it just occurred to me as I was still operating using an old school technique, that I need to evolve.<p></p>
Do it on my handheld. Quit printing paper.
