It really bums me out when I can't share a news article I am reading.  I read a lot of blogs and news throughout the day.  

I have finally gotten in the habit of sharing news via facebook or my twitter profile because of well placed sharing icons.

However it frustrates me when I read a great piece of news and look to share...and I can't.

Hard to believe any news outlet would not be on board with social sharing.
