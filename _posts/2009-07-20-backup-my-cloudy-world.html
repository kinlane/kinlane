I came across a post about a new web service. It is a <a href="http://backupmy.net/">cloud backup tool</a>. Something I have talked about needing several times. Handy backup utility for all my favorite cloud based applications.<p></p>
<a href="http://backupmy.net/">BackupMy.Net</a> is a handy tool that does this for you.<p></p>
They provide cloud backup services for:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Top Email Platforms (<a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http://google.com">Gmail</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Hotmail" rel="homepage" href="http://www.hotmail.com/">Hotmail</a>, or Windows Live)</li>
	<li>Top Blog Platforms (Wordpress, <a class="zem_slink" title="Blogger" rel="homepage" href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a>, or <a class="zem_slink" title="TypePad" rel="homepage" href="http://www.typepad.com/">Typepad</a>)</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>Top Picture Platforms (<a class="zem_slink" title="Flickr" rel="homepage" href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="SmugMug" rel="homepage" href="http://www.smugmug.com/">SmugMug</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Picasa" rel="homepage" href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Photobucket" rel="homepage" href="http://www.photobucket.com">Photobucket</a>)</li>
</ul>
This is definitely a great service. Although I have to ask...will I actually pay for it? I blindly depend on these cloud services to maintain my data for me.<p></p>
Also, who will backup the backup. So if I pay this service to aggregate my data, how do I browse / manage it. And what happens if they go away?<p></p>
Don't get me wrong I think this is a great service. Being the picky developer I am...I would like to see a single utility like Jungle Disk that I could map to various cloud services and choose to backup either to my local drive / disk, Amazon EC2, or Mosso Cloud. It would give me more control over it.
