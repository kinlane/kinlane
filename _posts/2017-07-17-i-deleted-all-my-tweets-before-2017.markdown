Continuing the grooming of my digital self, I've deleted all my Tweets prior to 2017. These tweets offer almost no beneft to my traffic to my site, or the sales of my content, products, and services. They do contain many things that could be taken out of context, and potentially be used as leverage against me when it comes to potential legal cases, insurance prices, credit decisions, job or project prospects, and many other negative things that I just do not need in my world.

So far [I've deleted my Gmail](http://kinlane.com/2017/07/06/i-deleted-all-but-the-last-six-months-of-my-gmail/), and [my Facebook history](http://kinlane.com/2017/07/14/i-flushed-the-last-nine-years-of-my-facebook-profile/) for anything @kinlane. I've also cleaned up my storage units for Amazon S3 and Dropbox, putting anything historical on a local drive, and secondarily on an SD card that is stored in separate location. I'm not deleting my accounts, or taking unrealistic stances with my digital presence, I'm just cleaning up things and keeping my house in order. Having these massive archives out there don't do me any good, and only really benefit the platforms, and 3rd parties who are looking to enrich their data sets.

This is a practice I'm only applying to my personal accounts. If it is @apievangelist, or another one of my professional productions I am keeping the history in place as it brings benefits to the table, and tends to be more business focused. I'm also not cleaning up my personal blogging on kinlane.com, and my other personal domains, as this archive is within my control to clean up and delete at any time I desire. I consider this practice something I am calling reclaim. It is just the regular practice of maintaining my personal digital presence, assert control over what the web says about me, and limiting potential damage to my online, and offline worlds.

I wish that I had more trust in these service providers, but in the current online climate I just don't trust that they have my back, and are being honest with me regarding who they are sharing my information with. I also don't trust the ENTIRE online world these days. There are too many folks looking to troll, incite mayhem, and chaos. With this effort, I am just looking to minimize the surface in which they have access to when it comes to stirring their cyber(in)security pots, and limit any potential damage in my life. 

**Update:** I never shared the tool I used - [TweetDeleter](https://www.tweetdeleter.com/en/tweets). I purposely used this instead of the API, because I wanted others to be able to do it without any coding skills.
