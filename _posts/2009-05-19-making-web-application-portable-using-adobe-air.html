I am enjoying taking a current web application and making it run in <a class="zem_slink" title="Adobe Integrated Runtime" rel="homepage" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe Air</a>. So far I have quickly ported an existing <a class="zem_slink" title="ColdFusion" rel="homepage" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion">ColdFusion</a> web application over to run within a downloadable <a class="zem_slink" title="Adobe Systems" rel="homepage" href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a> Air application.<p></p>
It runs as it does in the browser with a few modifications.<p></p>
It is completely dependent on an internet connection. Next I will be playing with the underlying data model and see what I can as far as replicating its database locally and run off a local database and sync with live when an Internet connection is available.<p></p>
Fun stuff, I could see a lot of potential here for taking existing apps and making portable versions, or online product catalogs and making them run independently of their public web site.<p></p>
More to come on this topic as I work to migrate various WEG Applications.
