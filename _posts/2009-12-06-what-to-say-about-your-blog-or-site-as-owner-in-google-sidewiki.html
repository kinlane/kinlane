Was just viewing my last blog post and noticed the Google Sidewiki that I had installed recently.<p></p>
I haven't given it much thought since I installed.<p></p>
Then it asked me to comment on one of my blog posts. It says:<p></p>
<strong>As the page owner, you can write a special entry that will remain the top entry for this page.</strong><p></p>
What should I write? What is the best tone to take when comment on your blog or page? <strong>
