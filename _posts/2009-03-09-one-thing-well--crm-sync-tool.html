In my theme of doing one thing and doing it well....I am going to start proposing business ideas that I either come across or come up with myself.<p></p>
Here is an idea that would do well, maybe its already out there...I haven't had time to do due diligence.<p></p>
Contact Sync Tool.<p></p>
Now I know this exists in several formats, between Outlook and <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http://google.com">Google</a>, etc. I am talking about a <a class="zem_slink" title="Software as a service" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> that this is all they do. They sync up between all known major and minor systems.<p></p>
I have seen people asking of sync between <a class="zem_slink" title="LinkedIn" rel="homepage" href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, and Facebook and their <a class="zem_slink" title="Customer relationship management" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM</a>.<p></p>
Seems like someone who focused on exclusively doing this could do it well...and charge a simple fee to access each account. If a company just focused on this and didn't do it in a selfish or proprietary manner it would be a great selling service.
