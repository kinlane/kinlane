It came up in a conversation today so I thought I would discuss it more. I know I've talked about a Universal Presence before, I'll provide some links later.<p></p>
What I mean by a universal presence is moving beyond an obsession with just your web site and google search results.<p></p>
In short you need to pay attention your Facebook profile just as much as you do your web site. All I am saying is a healthy Social Network and Social Media presense will soon deliver a better quality realationship than your web site can deliver alone.<p></p>
These should all be tools in your toolbox:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Web Site</li>
	<li>Blog</li>
	<li>Facebook Profile</li>
	<li>LinkedInProfile</li>
	<li>Twtter Account</li>
	<li>YouTube Channel</li>
	<li>Flickr Profile</li>
</ul>
You should put an equal amount of energy into each of these areas. Come up with creative ways of providing content and engaging your customers.<p></p>
This is just a start. There are many ways to engage social media at:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Forums</li>
	<li>QA Sites</li>
	<li>Wikis</li>
	<li>File Sharing Sites</li>
	<li>Company Profile Sites</li>
</ul>
And much much more. I just had to get this down as a starter and will elaborate soon.
