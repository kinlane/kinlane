One thing I'm really enjoying with all the web 2.0, social, cloudy, mobile goodness that is going on these days is the general democratization of computing.<p></p>
Cheap computers, mobile phones and cloud computing puts computing power in everyone hand.<p></p>
Even though I've spent the last 20 years programming and running servers, I don't feel like a computer programmer. I feel like I've hacked most of it.<p></p>
The most important lesson of Cloud Computing is the opening up and democratization of the block box formerly known as Information Technology (IT).<p></p>
Computer Science is not a good ol boy network of elite college degree geeks. The man can't hide behind the curtain anymore.<p></p>
With the flood of <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/software-as-a-service-saas/">Software as a Service</a> (SaaS), <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/platform-as-a-service-paas/">Platform as a Service </a>(PaaS), and DIY web 2.0 tools available anyone can be a programmer, web designer, designer, syadmin or any the class roles.<p></p>
