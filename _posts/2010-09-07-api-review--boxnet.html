I am walking through the <a href="http://developers.box.net/" target="_blank">Box.net OpenBox Developer</a> area tonight. <a href="http://www.Box.net"> Box.net</a> offers a pretty robust set of API for managing files and content on the box.net platform.<p></p>
It is a great example of a very robust API.  They get you started with:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Introduction to OpenBox Actions</li>
	<li>Getting Started Guide for API</li>
	<li>Easy Sig-nup</li>
	<li>Project Setup Page</li>
</ul>
They provide several flavors to their API:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li> REST</li>
	<li> SOAP</li>
	<li> XML-RPC</li>
</ul>
They provide some some great code samples and libraries in all the top programming languages.<p></p>
They provide a list of of all their API functions right off the left hand menu, broken down into categories:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Authentication</li>
	<li>File &amp; Folder Operations</li>
	<li>Sharing</li>
	<li>Tagging</li>
	<li>Commenting</li>
	<li>Download and Upload</li>
</ul>
They support their API with a developers blog and even provide an email address to contact them directly. They even have a mobile API offering!<p></p>
I think they offer a solid API. As with many rockstar Web 2.0 applications it stops there. They don't offer a great API Community or Ecoystem. Its pretty evident the API came out of the development team.<p></p>
The API lacks consistency and seems to be spread between developers.box.net and box.net/developers. The overall approach lacks community and even has some broken links.<p></p>
They talk about some partners and API implementations on their blog, but don't showcase their developers, partners as part of the API which really contributes to a sense of community. Overall as a director of technology I would be hesitant to push for integration of the API because I feel like the API is kind of an afterthought and I wouldn't get much support.<p></p>
Without actual experience in integration of course, this is all speculation. Although I think this reflects a common approach to delivering an API. They come out with a strong product, but without a solid business, marketing and management approach it can leave a lot to desire. Leaving many questions in my head that may lead to me walking away and look at other API solutions.
