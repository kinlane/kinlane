<p><img class="alignnone" title="CityGrid Logo" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/citygrid_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I wanted a way to make the rich content available via&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid APIs" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>&nbsp;accessible to anyone, even if you weren't a developer.</p>
<p>CityGrid has some great&nbsp;<a title="iOS and Android software development kits (SDK) available for building local, mobile applications" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/SDKs">iOS and Android software development kits (SDK) available for building local, mobile applications</a>.</p>
<p>I've also built some&nbsp;<a title="samples and starter kits for building local web applications in PHP, Python and Ruby" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Code+Samples">samples and starter kits for building local web applications in&nbsp;PHP, Python and Ruby</a>.</p>
<p>WordPress seemed like the perfect next step to reach a larger audience, so I took the PHP&nbsp;<a title="Hyp3rL0cal" href="/">Hyp3rL0cal</a>&nbsp;directory that uses&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid Places API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API">CityGrid Places API</a>, and deployed it as a Wordpress Plugin.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="CityGrid Logo" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/CityGrid.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Now you can launch a quick section on your Wordpress blog or site that allows you to display businesses for your area, in whatever category you wish.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin" href="http://wordpress-local-directory.hyp3rl0cal.com/">CityGrid Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin</a>&nbsp;is meant to be a project that developers can learn from and even deploy their own local WordPress Plugins that use CityGrid APIs. &nbsp;However its completely functional and could be deployed by any non-developer as well.</p>
<p>Right now you can&nbsp;<a title="download or fork at Github" href="https://github.com/kinlane/Hyp3rL0cal-Wordpress-Plugin">download or fork at Github</a>, as I stabilize it further I will publish to the&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid developer center code samples page" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Code+Samples">CityGrid developer center code samples page</a>.</p>
