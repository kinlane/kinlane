Was just reading the post on Wired about the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/04/aussies-announc.html">Australian broadband initiatiave</a>. Makes me wish our government would really get on the ball with this issue.<p></p>
Fiber to the door of every americans home should be a high priority. Its an issue that is long over due.<p></p>
Of course you can reach every home, but high quality broadband should be available everywhere. It should be low cost to help ensure Americans stay on top of the technology movement.
