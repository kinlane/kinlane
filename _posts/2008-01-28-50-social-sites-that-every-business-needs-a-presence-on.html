Everyone is a little intimidated and overwhelmed about where to start with your <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com/">social media marketing campaign</a>.  There are so many sites and so few metrics for evaluating your success.<br /><br />You really can't ignore social media for your company anymore, if you do your competitors are going to eat your lunch.  So where do you start?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.insidecrm.com/">InsideCRM</a> just released a great list of <a href="http://www.insidecrm.com/features/50-social-sites-012808/">50 social media sites that every business needs a presence on</a>.<br /><br />It is a pretty comprehensive list with a great introduction to each.  They cover the following types of Social Network Sites:<strong><br /></strong><ul class="mainlist"><li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Social-Media/Social-Bookmarking Sites</span></strong></li><li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Professional-Networking Sites</span></strong></li><li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Niche Social-Media Sites</span></strong></li><li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">General Social-Media Sites</span></strong></li><li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Job Sites</span></strong></li></ul>It is probably more sites than the average business can handle, but it is a great place to start.
