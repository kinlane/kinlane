<p>I am slowly getting back into the routine of doing my weekly roundups. It has been a while since I published any, even though I regularly do the work. While I was going through this week's roundup of items I curated, I thought some of the blockchain related goings on were particularly interesting.</p>

<p>Not sure about you but I can't help but think that has the makings of a pretty interesting economic engine for the cybersecurity&nbsp;industry. You have government hackers, organized hackers, rando hackers, concerns around having enough talent, investors pouring money into the space,&nbsp;and 1000lb pound gorillas making firing up their digital factories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing that blockchain and cybersecurity&nbsp;are going to go hand in hand, and be a very lucrative endeavor for a select few.</p>
