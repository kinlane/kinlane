I really like this contact information on this site I was researching tonight. The colors don't really appeal to me. It is the fact that their contact information is clearly:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Available on every page at the bottom.</li>
	<li>Provides Email, Phone, Twitter, Instant Message</li>
	<li>Links newsletter information</li>
	<li>Links to blog</li>
</ul>
These are all mission critical ways of staying in touch with customers. Users should never have to search around a site to look for contact information.
