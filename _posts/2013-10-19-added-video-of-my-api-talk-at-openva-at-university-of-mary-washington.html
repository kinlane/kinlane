<p>I gave a talk as part of the <a href="http://openva.org/">Mind the Future discussion at the #OpenVA gathering on the University of Mary Wasington campus</a> last Monday. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My talk was focused on helping educational institutions the role APIs will play in the future of education, and helping ensure web literacy across our society.</p>
<p>You can <a href="/admin/blog/kinlane.github.io/talks/open-va/future-of-edu/">find the slides from my talk</a>, along with <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/">my other talks on Github</a>. I've added the talk to my video section of my site, but you can also view below.&nbsp;</p>
