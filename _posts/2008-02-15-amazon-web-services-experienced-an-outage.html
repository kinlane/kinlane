Amazon Web Services experienced an outage this morning across all their systems.  There is a flurry of posts on this forum about the <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=19714&amp;tstart=0">Amazon Web Services Outage</a>.<br /><br />This is the first actual outage I have seen or heard of on the Amazon Web Services Platform.  Definitely a black eye for Amazon Web Services and building credibility with the community to use them as the core of their networks.<br /><br />Gives some fuel to the argument that no matter what infrastructure you use that you should have a Plan B.<br /><br />There were some really scared and frustrated people out there questioning their business models. <br /><br />I really hope Amazon can recover from this, I really have been pushing AWS and evangelizing with various clients.
