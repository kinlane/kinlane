<p></p>
As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts.  This is a first post in my ongoing evaluation of  the role of APIs in 3D printing and manufacturing.
<p></p>
I'm working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.
<p></p>
I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong><a title="Creators" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-the-creators/">Creators</a></strong> - 3D designers of virtual print objects</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Scanners" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-3d-scanners/">Scanners</a></strong> - Scanning hardware for generating 3D models</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Modeling Software" href="ttp://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-modeling-software/">Modeling Software</a></strong> - Applications for building 3D models</li>
	<li><strong><a title="File Formats" href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=3599">File Formats</a></strong> - File formats for storing 3D models</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Warehousing" href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=3603">Warehousing</a></strong> - Virtual storage for 3D models</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Marketplaces" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-marketplaces/">Marketplaces</a></strong> - Arenas for showcasing, distributing and ordering 3D products</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Printers" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printers-printers/">Printers</a></strong> - Companies and hardware that deliver 3D printing</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Process &amp; Materials" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-process-materials/">Process &amp; Materials</a></strong> - The process and materials that go into 3D printing</li>
	<li><strong><a title="Makers" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-makers/">Makers</a></strong> - The people who understand 3D printers, process, materials akinlane-productions2
	<li><strong><a title="Delivery" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-delivery/">Delivery</a></strong> - Logistics behind getting 3D printed products to consumers</li>
</ul>
Of course this is just my perspective of the industry and can evolve as I learn more, and collaborate with other industry players.<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-manufacturing.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<p></p>
I've been fortunate enough to talk with key people from <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a>,  <a title="Makerbot" href="http://www.makerbot.com/">Makerbot</a>, and <a title="Cloudfab" href="http://cloudfab.com/">Cloudfab</a>, and get their opinion on the role of APIs in 3D printing and manufacturing.
<p></p>
This series was just to help me understand the major components, and I will do another series on how APIs can impact these areas.
<p></p>
Then I will do a summary post on <a title="ProgrammableWeb.com" href="http://www.ProgrammableWeb.com">ProgrammableWeb.com</a> about the role of APIs in 3D printing.
