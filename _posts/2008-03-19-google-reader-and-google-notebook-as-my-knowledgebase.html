I use Google Reader and Google Notebook on a daily basis.  I read and consume feeds from 300+ blogs daily.  I scan, read, visit and participate in many of the posts. <br /><br />I then either tag the blog entries in my Google Reader.<br /><br />Or I visit the blog and highlight some or all of the text and add to my Google Notebook.<br /><br />I keep huge amounts of information in both of these. <br /><br />With the combination of tagging in Google Reader and organizing in notebooks in Google Notebook and keep track of meaningful information.<br /><br />Both give me a search tool to then pull this information up at anytime.<br /><br />What a great database.
