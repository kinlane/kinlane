For some reason today I got a nervous feeling that I have too many Amazon EC2 instances up and running....I was up to 20 instances mid week to support our event in May. I shut them down 24 hours later, but for some reason I got worried that I had left some up and running.<p></p>
I have done this before....left an instance running a day or two longer than I should have. In this economy we can't be spending any more than we have to. And my EC2 budget has been running high, playing with our new found power.<p></p>
Definitely a catch of the on demand power, you can launch and scale as you need it. However you can also leave processing and storage power out there without thinking about it.<p></p>
Earlier this week I had taken a tour of SkyTap, another cloud provider. They do not focus on production environments, they focus on the testing, prototyping and QA side of server and application development.<p></p>
One feature they had that I really liked.....when launching an instance you can set a schedule of its life.....and it will shut down on that specified schedule.<p></p>
Great feature. Seems like something Amazon could adopt to help us IT people with tight budgets.
