I love data. When I find great sources of data I have to record it.<p></p>
Here is RAW and API data from the Federal Government.<p></p>
<strong><a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/action/data.php">OpenSecrets Open Data</a></strong><p></p>
It has:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Campaign Finance - PAC and individual contributions to, and expenditures by, Candidates, PACs and Party Committees</li>
	<li>Lobbying - Clients, registrants (generally lobbying firms), lobbyists and bills lobbied</li>
	<li>527s Data - Committees, Receipts and Expenditures</li>
	<li>Personal Finances - Agreements, Assets and Liabilities, Outside Compensation and Income, Honoraria and Gifts, Positions, Transactions, Travel</li>
	<li>Resource tables such as Category Codes, Expense Codes, Members of Congress, etc</li>
</ul>
Good stuff. I will start working through this data.
