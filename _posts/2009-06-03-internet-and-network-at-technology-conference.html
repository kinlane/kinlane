I'm not being to formal about my posts coming together from the <a class="zem_slink" title="Google I/O" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/events/io/">Google I/O</a> conference. A lot of work this week so I haven't had time to pull together.<p></p>
So I am just going to rant about a few items randomly. One of them is the network and Internet connectivity at conference centers and events.<p></p>
First put the Registration, Information, Session Speakers, Exhibitors and all non-attendees on a separate network. There were several important sessions where the presenter was unable to continue for a while because of network latency. How bad is this? Build out capacity for them to accomplish this part of conference.<p></p>
Then build out the appropriate network for attendees. Make it a great user experience for everyone. We live in the digital age. People are using laptops and handheld devices. Make it possible for them.<p></p>
Conference centers and show managers need to make sure they hire a competent team to tackle this...and make it so.<p></p>
It was just unacceptable that at Google I/O developer conference there was any Internet connectivity issues.
