As part of my 3rd party service development plan for my company I make recommendations for external systems that my company should be using for its operations. We don't buy or develop everything internally. There are some amazing 3rd party applications.
<p></p>A couple notable ones are:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Gmail / Google Apps for Your Domain
     </li>
     <li>Google Docs
     </li>
     <li>Google Calendar
     </li>
     <li>Email Center Pro (ECP)
     </li>
</ul>These are applications that I have integrated heavily into our daily operations. Another characteristic they all have is they are heavy JavaScript based applications. One thing I started noticing is my non-tech savvy employees tend to leave these programs open and running all day long. And many will leave their browser open for multiple days with the same application open.
<p></p>Most users are using IE, but a few use Firefox. Memory leaks become a major problem. People's machines slow to a crawl and many times just lock up. I can people complaining and worried applications or their machines.
<p></p>So I started recommending using Google Chrome for their web-based JavaScript application. In initial tests I opened Gmail Personal, Google Docs Personal, Gmail for Google Apps, Google Docs for Apps, and Email Center Pro in both Chrome and Firefox.
<p></p>I left these open all night:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Firefox started at about 50K and grew to 480K by morning.
     </li>
     <li>Chrome started at about 50K and reduced to 46K by morning.
     </li>
</ul>All without usage? I am leaving open all day to see what happens next.
