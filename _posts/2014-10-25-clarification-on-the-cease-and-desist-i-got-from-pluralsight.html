<p>I wanted to clarify a tweet from yesterday, where I said that <em>"I just got a cease and desist to take down a showcase I did on @pluralsight API training demos. Won't make that mistake again</em>"&mdash;if you aren't familiar with them, Pluralsight is <em>&ldquo;the largest online #ITAdmin, #Developer &amp; creative training library on the planet"</em>. Tweets are so bad for getting all the details across, and I wanted to add that I actually agree with the request Pluralsight was making, just not their approach.</p>
<p>What happened was, a link had come across my monitoring, about a Pluralsight training video on APIs, which I curated, and added the link to my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API Design research</a>. The problem was that the link was to a 3rd party site, not actually to Pluralsight. The cease &amp; desist email I got was asking me to remove the link to the 3rd party website&mdash;which makes sense, and I&rsquo;m happy to oblige.</p>
<p>What I do not agree with is the approach by Pluralsight in using cease and desist to get me to address the problem. It is a particularly shitty first impression to leave on someone, especially someone who runs one of the top sites for learning about a fast growing space for developers&mdash;APIs. As you can tell by this post, I will not ever link to Pluralsight again, and beyond this post you won't catch me talking about them again in stories, white papers, or at my conferences, meetups, and workshops.</p>
<p>Pluralsight is just using an anti-piracy service (which I won't showcase), and think it is a safe bet to say they aren't really aware of what is going on. I&rsquo;m sure they have a pretty bad piracy problem, but I&rsquo;m thinking a blind cease &amp; desist campaign might not be the best approach. Maybe a first email saying, &ldquo;hey! you have a link we don't like, would you consider swapping it out with a valid link?&rdquo;, might be a better approach.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, we'll file this post under &ldquo;rant&rdquo;. I hope your anti-marketing strategy works out for you Pluralsight. I&rsquo;m really happy to be in a space where I generate content that I can encourage the widest possible distribution, and not have to police websites like Pluralsight does.</p>
