I just answered a question on LinkedIn...shortly thereafter I received a connection request from the QA thread.   

I happily accepted the connection request.  As I was thanking the person I though...it would be real nice to have "notes" that store with each contact.  

This way I could jot down notes as I make connections or communicate with people that will give their relationship to me more context.  

These would be private notes, only available to me so I can understand why I made this connection.

There are many contacts I have befriended that I either don't remember why I made the connection or would value the connection more if I remembered specific conversations with them.
