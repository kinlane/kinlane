When I start working I tend to open a handful of work-based applications that I need open all the time while I work. A few of the must have applications are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Google Home Page</li>
	<li>GMail</li>
	<li>Google Calendar</li>
	<li>Eclipse</li>
	<li>SQL Server Manager</li>
	<li>Remote Desktop</li>
</ul>
A few applications that I open up that are not critical, but allow me to communicate and manage my network are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Skype</li>
	<li>Windows Live Messenger</li>
	<li>Yahoo</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>Myspace</li>
	<li>LinkedIn</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
</ul>
Just shows how some applicaitons become business critical for me and others are not. Seems I could get more done business wise within my Facebook or LinkedIn profiles.<p></p>
Need more applications and tools for doing this.
