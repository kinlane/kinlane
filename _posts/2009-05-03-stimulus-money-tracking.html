I have seen a lot of press about how the stimulus money is being spend and tracked. I have come across many ideas for how this should be tracked.<p></p>
I have gone through all 50 states recovery web sites as well as many of the federal agency web sites. There is definitely no rhyme or reason to how thiis money and projects are being tracked.<p></p>
I see several organizations such as the <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.followthemoney.org/">National Institute on Money in State Politics</a>, <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/">OMB Watch</a>, and many others that are pursuing Government <a class="zem_slink" title="Transparency (behavior)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_%28behavior%29">transparency</a>, data feeds and general accountability of government with the assistance of technology and cloud computing.<p></p>
Today I came across a software solution from <a href="http://www.acumensolutions.com">Acumen</a> called, <a href="http://www.acumensolutions.com/START.asp">Stimulus Tracking and Recipient Transparency</a> that provides a <a href="http://www.acumensolutions.com/START.asp">ready to go solution for agencies to track economic stimulus money</a>.<p></p>
Interesting solution, as I learn more I will share my findings.
