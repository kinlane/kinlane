<p>I&rsquo;m continuing the <a title="migration of all my projects to run on Github" href="/2013/01/02/all-side-projects-are-now-hosted-on-github/">migration of all my projects to run on Github</a>.  Eventually all public areas of my site will run as static, published Github pages and supporting back-end repositories.  Last night I migrated <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">API aggregation</a>, <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">Backend as a Service</a>, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">Reciprocity</a> and <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">Real-Time</a> providers using a version of my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> format.</p>
<p>While <a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a> will still remain the master doorway to all my work, each project will live under its own subdomain and Github repository.  As I make this switch I&rsquo;m having to adjust my Google Analytics strategy as well as potentially my Google Feedburner strategy.  In the shadow of the Google Reader deprecation I&rsquo;m reconsidering not just how I consume RSS, but my analytics as well.</p>
<p>I can keep using Google Analytics for pages, and Google Feedburner for RSS.  But I&rsquo;d also like data on how JSON files are consumed as well, which neither platform provide me.  Using the Github API I can track on the activity around a repository like commits, follows, downloads and forks, but I don&rsquo;t get actually page view activity on pages or individual files.</p>
<p>Really my only hope for getting the data I need is from Github.  Some sort of raw web logs for our domain, would be sweeeet!!  Then I could see how many times a JSON file is accessed, and build custom reporting tools for Github page views, Jekyll blog views, etc and migrate away from Google Analytics.</p>
<p>I've looked briefly for any Github solutions, but everything is client-side tracking. &nbsp;Let me know if I'm missing anything.</p>
