The WebSocket API allows bidirectional   communications with a server. Think of this one as how you wish AJAX would have been. Not only do you have <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/07/html-5-server-sent-events/">Server-Sent Events with HTML 5</a>, you can actually have multi-directional communication with any web server.
<p></p>
This really opens up the possibilities of making web applications more real-time.

You can make your HTML 5 web application communicate, collaborate and receive updates in real-time through web sockets and server-sent events. Definitely a big step in the evolution of web applications.
