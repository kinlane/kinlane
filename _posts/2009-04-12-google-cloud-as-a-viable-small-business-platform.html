So I have used Google as a platform for a while. I did several large scale social media marketing campaigns completely using Google as a platform.<p></p>
They just have the best software services, platform services, and infrastructure services.<p></p>
I have been finding the best route to provide a easy, but effective solution for some my mom and brother's technology platform.<p></p>
Google is the logical choice because with a domain I immediately get email, calendaring, document sharing, wiki / sites, and a dashboard.<p></p>
I was just playing with the sites again to see how far it can be customized. Noticed they added direct subdomain mapping to an individual site now.<p></p>
The Google Sites has very nice Google Document integration. You can embed anything from Google Apps.<p></p>
You can quickly embed a calendar, document, picasa web slideshow, presentation, spreadsheet, spreadsheet form, videos, or gadgets. And with gadgets...the sky is the limit.<p></p>
So I setup a site for my cloud computing research I am doing. I have a site with home, about, and contact information.<p></p>
Researching more advanced tools now....
