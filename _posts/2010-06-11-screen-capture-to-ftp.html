I was just test driving the <a href="http://www.spgrab.com/">Free Screenshot Sharing Application</a> called <a href="http://www.spgrab.com/">SPGrab</a>. I like the idea of seamless sharing after you take a screenshot. They allow you to automatically upload to FTP location of your choice. Putting it in a ftp location you potentially have the ability to automatically share it.<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="SPGrab Screencapture" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/spgrab.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />

I spend a lot of time uploading screenshots to a Google Doc, Worpdress Blog or orther online tool. Having it automatically available at a public IP address or domain is valuable.
<p></p>
I might be a little different than other users, but I immediately upload all my screenshots to Amazon S3 using my S3Fox tool I like all my images to be server independent and stored in a central location I know isn't going away and I can control access. Amazon S3 gives me this control.

That would be a great feature <a href="http://www.spgrab.com/">SPGrab</a>, automatically uploading to the Amazon S3 Bucket of my choice.
