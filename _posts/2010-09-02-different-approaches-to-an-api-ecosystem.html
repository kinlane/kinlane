<p></p>
These are all top web 2.0 or cloud applications. Whichever label you wish to apply.
<p></p>
I am evaluating the different approaches to delivering their API Ecosystem:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Zendesk </strong>- Offers web-based customer support software and their API is pretty much a feature or extension of that software. They offer up API integration documentation and the rest is built into your Zendesk account area.</li>
	<li> <strong>Scribd </strong>- Offers cloud based document sharing. Their API is packaged up neatly in a Developers / API area, with all the necessary building blocks for an API community. Great API delivery.</li>
	<li> <strong>Twilio </strong>- Offers voice and SMS web services. Their API is different because it is their core offering. It isn't a second thought or a different group of users. Twilio sells an API.</li>
	<li><strong>Evernote </strong>- Offers a web based note-taking and archiving web application. Their API is not their corekinlane-productions2ed through smaller developer area. They showcase an application marketplace heavily where users can showcase web, mobile and desktop apps that integrate with Evernote.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Scribd" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twilio.PNG" alt="" width="243" height="93" align="right" /></a>Twilio represents a new age <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/software-as-a-service-saas/">Software as a Service (SaaS)</a> where the entire product is built around an API offering. So they are kind of a different beast.
<p></p>
I would have to say that Scribd delivers the cleanest API Ecosystem with a great quick start, and robust set of building blocks for their API community. Zendesk and Evernote have great API, but their focus on delivering a complete API Ecosystem is a little fragmented and overshadowed by their core web application offerings.
