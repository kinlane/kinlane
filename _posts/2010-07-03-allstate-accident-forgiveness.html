<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Allstate Auto Insurance" src="http://thesettlementchannel.squarespace.com/storage/allstate%20logo.jpeg" alt="" width="265" height="240" align="right" />Its not often I blog about non technical issues and just rant and rave. This is one of those moments. This particular rant is about <a href="http://www.allstate.com" target="_blank">Allstate</a>, and cutting through the hype.<p></p>
I've been a loyal <a href="http://www.allstate.com" target="_blank">Allstate</a> customer for at least 10 years now, unsure of exact date...but around 10 years.  I have never had an accident. Never had an auto claim on my insurance.<p></p>
I was pulling out of the office a month or so ago and tapped a co-workers car. I mean tapped. I was able to push the corner of her plastic bumper out...no dent...just a scuff.<p></p>
I told her to get me a copy of the bill. It was $1200.00. There are sensors, yada yada in the bumper. Ok.<p></p>
So I submit to Allstate online to see what they'd say about it. The claims adjuster called me and talked through, I asked him will this affect my insurance rates?<p></p>
He said Noooo...your a loyal, long time customer. Its only $1200.00.<p></p>
Ok...well then go ahead and pay it, otherwise I will just pay it out of pocket.<p></p>
All is fine....then I get my 6 month bill yesterday. Instead of the normal $505.00 / 6 month. Its $987.00.<p></p>
So I call them and ask real nicely, why did my rates go up? er uh...why did my rates DOUBLE!!
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>You had an accident</li>
	<li>You no longer have two vehicles on your policy.</li>
	<li>Standard rate increase.</li>
</ul>
All 3 were reasons. I said...well I haven't owned two cars since my divorce over 2 years ago. So that is not true.<p></p>
She said...oh yeah...you right.<p></p>
I told her about the claims adjuster who said my rates wouldn't go up. She said oh. Sorry. I said well I can understand a standard rate increase, but when you <a href="http://www.allstate.com/auto-insurance/auto-insurance-features.aspx" target="_blank">advertise about accident forgiveness</a>, I am a 10 year no accident customer, and you tell me it won't raise my rates...and it does? She was silent.<p></p>
That is just dishonest Allstate....I'm now shopping around for car insurance. And spending 1 hour a week telling this story on various blogs, forums, QA sites, and hitting other news sources.
