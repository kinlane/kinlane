On my hunt for killer scripts and tools to go with with my Cloud Print API, I came across a way cool <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/flipbook-jquery-powered-w-media-gallery/152110" target="_blank">JQuery Flipbook</a> script over at <a href="http://codecanyon.net/" target="_blank">codecanyon</a>.

<a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/flipbook-jquery-powered-w-media-gallery/152110" target="_blank"> Flipbook jQuery</a> provides a magazine / book style display for digital media. The features include:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a> Powered</li>
	<li>Works with images, videos, audio and text</li>
	<li>Includes ZoomVideoPlayer</li>
	<li>Lightbox support</li>
</ul>
It also allows you to customize the width / height of the gallery.

I'm going to be bundling it with cloud printing bundle for previewing and interacting with print documents before sending off to be physically printed.

I don't think digital media delivered in a Flipbook format is a replacement for books or magazines, but is a great way to preview or browse content before physically committing to having it printed.
