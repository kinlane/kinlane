<p>I was reading a report commissioned by Google and conducted by Ipsos MediaCT in partnership with the Mobile Marketing Association and the Interactive Advertising Bureau, called <a title="Our Mobile Planet" href="http://www.ourmobileplanet.com/en/">Our Mobile Planet</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the report at <a title="Our Mobile Planet" href="http://www.ourmobileplanet.com/en/">OurMobilePlanet.com</a>. Included with the report on the mobile consumer, the site provides access to the full set of data from the research through a chart creation tool or the direct download of full country level data files.</p>

<p>The report is very informative, but the real story is how the report is published.  It is a complete site, report, reporting tools and full access to the data.  This is nothing new.  Its something <a title="The Guardian" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/data">The Guardian</a> does well in the context of data-driven journalism.</p>
<p>When it comes to research I think it should become the standard.  If you create a report, you should have to not only publish the report, you should provide interactive tools allowing non-developers to derive their own visualizations as well as raw data access for those who really want to dive deeper.</p>
<p>I think many companies who commission research are fine with just publishing the final results.  I feel pretty strongly that the next generation of research <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MUST</span></strong> have data visualization tools bundled with the report, as well as access to raw data so others can validate findings or take it in a potentially new direction.</p>
