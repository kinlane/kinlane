<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/poll_are_you_concerned_about_atts_new_data_limits.php">ATT decided to stop offering unlimited data plans to new customers  today</a>. I'm going to ride the Anti ATT sentiment for a bit.<p></p>
I  have several complaints about <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> that I need to explore here on my  blog.<p></p>
I have had the phone number <em>541-913-2328</em> on the  AT&amp;T network since January 1999. It was my primary business line  for the eight years I ran a web application development company. I have had my  complaints, but remained a loyal <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> customer.<p></p>
As time moves on  and I do more business with <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> I increasingly get frustrated with them.<p></p>
I have 4 mobile phone  lines:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>My primary number - <strong><em>IPhone </em></strong>- AT&amp;T Service</li>
	<li>My  secondary number -<strong> Android</strong> (Google I/O 2009) - AT&amp;TService</li>
	<li>My  third number - <em><strong>Blackberry</strong></em> - AT&amp;T Service (My daughter has this  phone)</li>
	<li>My business number - <em><strong>Blackberry </strong></em>- Verizon Service.</li>
</ul>
I  am not a phone user. I talk on the phone with co-workers and clients  only as required, I get straight to the point and get off the phone.<p></p>
I  am a heavy mobile browser, application, email and SMS user.<p></p>
I  also rely on my <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/">Verizon</a> Blackberry for Internet when I travel, by  tethering. Before I gave my daughter my <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> Blackberry, I had tethering  turn on for it as well. When I traveled with my daughter we would use both,  but when I was by myself the <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>network was always more reliable  and had faster connections. I couldn't justify two tethering bills.<p></p>
<em>Maybe  I'm not an average user? </em><p></p>
I have a couple of areas I'm  going to explore to express how I feel about <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> over the next couple days:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>AT&amp;T  Android vs. AT&amp;T IPhone</li>
	<li>AT&amp;T Network compared to  Verizon Network</li>
	<li>AT&amp;T Mobile at Sasquatch Music Festival</li>
	<li>AT&amp;T  Business and Residential DSL</li>
</ul>
It frustrates me that ATT doesn't  understand me as a user and the don't offer services and pricing plans that  reflect my needs. Beyond not understanding, they actually  seem to work against me.<p></p>
I have long felt that the traditional  Telecom Good Ol Boy network was bad for the open Internet. They just  seem to be stuck in in the old days of the telecommunication industry.  They don't get the Internet and understand how to change.<p></p>
I worry  that the American telecommunications industry will contribute to the  decline of the United States as a competitor in the global marketplace  by suffocating innovation in the name of profits.
