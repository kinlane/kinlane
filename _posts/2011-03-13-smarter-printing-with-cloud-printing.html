You have a collision of a dying industry and a game changing new technology.    I thought...this has to be a learning experience.   So I pursued the job.
<p></p>
First thing I learned:  <em>Print isn't dead.</em> Its evolving, and the largest beasts in this industry (newspapers, magazines, book publishers) are too big to adjust, and they start wailing as they die.
<p></p>
Print is far from dead.  It is still a big part of daily business operations around the world.  Technology like mobile phones and social networks are evolving print.
<p></p>
Its not about print dying or going away, its about smarter printing.
