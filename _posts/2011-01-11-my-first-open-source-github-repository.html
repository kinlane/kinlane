I have checked out and downloaded code from plenty of <a href="http://github.com">github</a> repositories. I've even help manage a couple of private repositories for clients.

I have never actually shared an open source repository before. A virgin of sorts.

I posted the <a href="https://github.com/mimeoconnect/Mimeo-Connect-Cloud-Print-API---REST-Client" target="_blank">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API PHP REST Client</a> today.  It is a simple PHP Class for consuming the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print REST API.

It the <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request2/docs/latest/HTTP_Request2/_HTTP_Request2-0.5.1---Request2.php.html" target="_blank">PEAR Request2 librar</a>y to make REST calls against any of the REST service endpoints.

It is the first of hopefully many code libraries and applications I will be open sourcing and publishing to <a href="http://github.com">github</a>.
