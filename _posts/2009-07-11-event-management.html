We just launched a new web site for our company <a href="http://www.webeventsglobal.com">WebEvents Global</a>. It is a new start for our web presence. We do not really have a need for a web site to market our <a href="http://www.webeventsglobal.com">event management products and services</a>.<p></p>
We rely on worth of mouth and networking in the very close knit <a href="http://www.webeventsglobal.com">event and conference management</a> industry.<p></p>
It really bothers me that you can't Google <a href="http://www.webeventsglobal.com">event management</a> or other top keywords and find us. We don't strive to be the largest or most recognized <a class="zem_slink" title="Event management" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_management">event management</a> company, we enjoy being a "boutique" operations. I would like  web presence that represents this position in the industry.<p></p>
So we have worked slowly to create a simple web site to present our selves. I have also worked on our <a class="zem_slink" title="Social network" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social network</a> presence somewhat by making sure our Facebook, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/companies/webevents-global">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/webeventsglobal">Twitter</a> profiles are in check.<p></p>
It isn't much, but its a start. We are meeting this month to really flush out how the rest of the world sees us.<p></p>
Even though we don't depend on it for getting work, it is nice to have a clearly defined online presence when I talk to vendors, partners, and other event industry folks we network with.
