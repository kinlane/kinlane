<p><a title="Urban Airship" href="http://urbanairship.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1035" title="urban-airship-logo" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/urban-airship-logo1-300x203.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a><a title="Urban Airship" href="http://urbanairship.com/">Urban Airship</a>&nbsp;came out with some new push notification tools this week, including services that allow you to slice-and-dice your mobile application audiences by location, time, context and preference--allowing you to improve the relevancy and targeting of messages and offers.</p>
<p>Some examples they give are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>a national retailer could off-load excess inventory held by various stores by targeting offers to people in those cities or multiple ZIP codes that have a preference for that product category.</li>
<li>a sports or entertainment venue could target people that are nearby right now to drive attendance on a slow day, or offer longer-term promotions for people that were visitors within the last six months but not in the prior three months.</li>
<li>a media site could define custom segments called Travelers or Movers based on changes in cities, states or countries over time, and bolster its breaking news pushes with useful local content.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />The new Urban Airship products are&nbsp;<a title="Push" href="http://urbanairship.com/products/push-composer/">Push</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Rich Push" href="http://urbanairship.com/products/rich-push/">Rich Push&reg;</a>&nbsp;composers, allowing users to construct targeted segments that join location information with in-app behaviors, preferences and device profiles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;As an always-on-you device, smart-phones and apps offer the ability to accurately know where people are and what they care about, but too often marketers cast a wide net using only snapshots of insight,&rdquo; said Scott Kveton, CEO and co-founder, Urban Airship. &ldquo;In ignoring individuals&rsquo; context and behavior over time, marketers risk losing the privilege of leveraging the most intimate communications channel available.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m adding Urban Airship to the&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid Local, Mobile Stack" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/tag/stack/">CityGrid Local, Mobile Stack</a>&nbsp;and will be weaving more of their services into what we offer here in the CityGrid Developer Center as well as our hackathon tools.</p>
