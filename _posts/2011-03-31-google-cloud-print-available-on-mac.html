<p></p>
You have been able to print on mobile versions of Google Docs and Gmail, and on Chrome running on Windows since February.
<p></p>
Today they released a Beta version of <a title="Google Cloud Print That Runs in Chrome for Mac" href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/p/cloudprint.html">Google Cloud Print that runs inChrome for MacOS</a> 10.5 and above.
<p></p>
So you can print any HTML, PDF, or any page you are viewing in the Chrome browser running on the Mac to your printer registered with Google Cloud Print.
