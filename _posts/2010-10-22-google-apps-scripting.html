Google introduced <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/10/automating-business-processes-in-google.html" target="_blank">scripting for Google Sites</a> today. <a href="http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/index.html" target="_blank">Google Apps Script</a> uses JavaScript to allow automation across Google products and interaction with 3rd party services.
<p></p>Google Apps Scripts allow you to:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Automate repetitive business processes
     </li>
     <li>Integrate 3rd party services within Google Apps
     </li>
     <li>Create custom spreadsheet functions
     </li>
     <li>Build and collect user inputs

</ul><img src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/googleapps.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /> With Google Apps Scripts you can interact with Google Base, Calendar, Contacts, Document, Finance, Language, Mail, Maps, Spreadsheets, and now Google Sites.
<p></p>In addition to accessing Google Products they provide many tools for working with UI, SOAP, XML and other helpful utilities.
<p></p>Google Sites moves beyond a simple wiki with the addition of Google Apps Scripting. It now is more of an application platform allowing integration with other Google products and 3rd party services.
