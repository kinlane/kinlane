<p>Obviously I&rsquo;m working with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> and <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> a little too much, because it has really started to affect my dreams. Last night I had a dream where I was working with a university research team to define a machine readable format for migrating concepts from the dream world into the physical world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I want this machine readable, but regardless it was a fun dream, and I wasn&rsquo;t worried about this in the dream, so I guess it is ok. In the dream I was able to go to sleep and dream about a concept, then wake up and apply the same concept in my regular day via my iPhone. It allowed me to pick and choose from a notebook of things I had experienced in my dreams, and then apply in my daily life as I chose.</p>
<p>This post lives in the grey space between my <a href="http://alternate.kinlane.com/">fictional storytelling</a>, and my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> storytelling, so I&rsquo;ll leave it here on Kin Lane. If you are planning a startup in this area, let me know. ;-)</p>
