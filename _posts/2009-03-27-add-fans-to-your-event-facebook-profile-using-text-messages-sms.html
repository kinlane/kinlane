Facebook is in the process of launching a new way for people to become fans of Facebook Pages using SMS text messaging.<p></p>
Now events, conferences and tradeshows will be able to get more Facebook fans by asking fans to text fan [your Facebook ID here] to FBOOK (32665).<p></p>
This is going to be a big deal for event marketers who've been looking for ways to accelerate their pages' growth.<p></p>
You can have people in a keynote, attending a session or visiting a booth become fans via their mobile devices in real-time.<p></p>
Currently, the text service is open only to some Facebook Pages. Look for a complete rollout soon. Another great social media marketing tool for events and conferences
