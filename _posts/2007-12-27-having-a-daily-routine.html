Was just reading a post by Ian Forrester called, <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com/blojsom/blog/cubicgarden/just+life/?permalink=Is-having-a-Routine-good-bad-or-indifferent.html">Is having a Routine good, bad or indifferent?</a>.  <br /><br />It is nice to see other technology professionals struggling with the same problem.  I am always working to have a balance between routine and "following the wind".<br /><br />I would say I lean more toward "following the wind" and less on routine.  I always have to work harder to inject more routine into my day. <br /><br />Part of it is the amount of work I have, and my routine tends to get dictated by the loudest clients.  Which is unfair to the rest of my world.<br /><br />I am sure my Mom would like to see me have more routine that included communicating with her.  I think that will definitely be an item I work into my routine more in 2008.<br /><br />Thanks Ian.
