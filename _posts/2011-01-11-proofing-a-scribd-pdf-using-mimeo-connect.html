Now the PDF we pulled from Scribd is proofed.   With the Product ID returned from the Mimeo Proof Service we can get the details of the proof.<p></p>
We need to make a second call to the Proof Service and Get the Proof.
<div style="border: 1px solid #000; width: 540px; padding: 10px; margin: 10px; text-align: left;"><code>$root_url = "connect.sandbox.mimeo.com/2010/09/";
$user_name = "[user name]";
$password = "[user password]";
$rest = new MimeoRESTclient($root_url,$user_name,$password);$documentId = "702e6c5b-35d8-4ffb-8d3c-cf779d9a13eb";
$url = "ProofService/Proof/" . $Product_ID;<p></p>
$rest-&gt;createRequest($url,"GET","");
$rest-&gt;sendRequest();
$output = $rest-&gt;getResponseBody();
$XMLArray = xmlstr_to_array($output);<p></p>
</code><code>for ($Page = 0; $Page &lt; $PageCount; $Page++)
{
$Small_Image_URL = $XMLArray['ProofPages']['ProofPage'][$Page]['SmallImage'];
$Large_Image_URL = $XMLArray['ProofPages']['ProofPage'][$Page]['LargeImage'];
}
</code><p></p>
</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">The Proof Service will return a small and large image representation for each page of our PDF. With the small image proofs we can create a preview of the document for displaying to users. The larger image proofs we can use to provide an actual interactive presentation of the document like a HTML5 flip-book or Flash format.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">In addition to proofing a copy of the PDF, the file is also placed in the My Mimeo account of the application making request or of another new user account created on the fly.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">Now our PDF content pulled from Scribd and proofed with the Mimeo Cloud Print API we can do several things:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Create a new product with PDF content, by merging with existing print document and save to My Mimeo Library.</li>
	<li>Create a new product with PDF content, by merging with existing print document and place new print order.</li>
	<li>We can leave file in our My Mimeo Library &gt; Proofed PDFs for future use.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">No matter what we do our content stored at Scribd is now ready to start building a document for printing with Mimeo.</div>
