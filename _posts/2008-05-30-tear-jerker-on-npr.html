Those of you know me, know that I'm an NPR junkie....I love the stories and music.  I listen to the StoryCorp programs every week.  Many touching stories.<br /><br />There was one today that really moved me:<br /><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90959458"><br />http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90959458</a><br /><br />It was a mom telling the story about how her 9 year old son died watching  a sunset.<br /><br />WOW.  That was moving.
