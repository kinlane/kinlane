I keep talking about how <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/06/small-business-it-review/">cloud computing is changing IT</a>, and IT managers need to pay attention. I just finished reading a blog that reminds me that <a href="http://consultingblogs.emc.com/simonmunro/archive/2010/06/15/project-managers-need-to-think-about-cloud-computing.aspx">project managers need to think about Cloud Computing</a> as well.<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 20px;" title="Project Managers" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/project-managers.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />

It talks about several key points project managers should consider:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Moving Activities Upstream </strong>- Some items that usually occur downstream, once a project is in motion need to be addressed as part of the planning.</li>
	<li><strong>Dealing with New Risks</strong> - Be aware of common risks with cloud computing, and be prepared for new ones at any moment.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/">C</a><strong><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/">loud Computing Projects</a> Will Be Different</strong> - Cloud computing is a different paradigm, even though it accomplishes many common business goals, but it is a new way of thinking.</li>
</ul>
I think many projects managers have already considered or are using cloud computing resources as part of their projects. They just might not be aware of it. Using <a href="project managers can essentially be the front line when it comes to cloud migration">Google Docs for collaboration</a> or Youtube for training videos would all be considered within the realm of cloud computing.
<p></p>
Project managers should be well versed in the basics of what cloud computing is, and take advantage of several established cloud tools that can help them deliver projects more efficiently. I think the real opportunity is with project managers when it comes businesses making the switch to cloud computing. IT managers often will be too entrenched to move to quickly, and <a href="project managers can essentially be the front line when it comes to cloud migration">project managers can essentially be the front line when it comes to cloud migration</a>.
