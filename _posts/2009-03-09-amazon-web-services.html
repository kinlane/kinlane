I figured I had better posting something technology related or my blog is gonna start looking like some sort of consumer report or rant and raves blog.<p></p>
Seems like the more I talk about and use Amazon Web Services the more questions and people I get wanting to talk about it.<p></p>
Get random people using the GTalk chad module on my blog, and people through my company who have business acquaintances that want to learn from our experience and our pains.<p></p>
The push to learn what Amazon's Cloud has to offer your business is growing.<p></p>
I know it has changed the way I do business, hope it can change yours too!
