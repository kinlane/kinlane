<p></p>
I was going to blog about it, but <a href="http://instagr.am/" target="_blank">Instragram</a> beat me to the punch and <a href="https://github.com/mislav/instagram/wiki" target="_blank">launched an API</a>. You can now access your Instagram account through an API and integrate it with other applications.
<p></p>
I would like to see a photo book generated from <a href="http://instagr.am" target="_blank">Instragram</a> photos. You could make some real cool artwork for the covers....and a layout that really compliments the Instagram photos.
<p></p>
With the Instragram API it would be easy to pull photos, merge them with a layout template and generate a PDF. You can then pass along with cover art to the Mimeo Cloud Print API for printing as a photobook.

Excited about the Instagram API and the potential for print.
