I have two Google Apps accounts.  One for <a href="http://www.kinlane.com" target="_blank">kinlane.com</a> and one for <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">apievangelist.com</a>.  I primarily have these Google Apps for the email.  So I just route info@kinlane.com and info@apievangelist.com to my kinlane@gmail.com account.

I have been using my free Gmail, Google Docs and Google Calendar for several years.  Even though Google Docs and Google Calendar are available in my Google Apps accounts I stick with using them in my free Google Accounts.

One of the main reasons I keep using my free account is Google Reader.  Google Reader has never been available as part of the Google Apps suite.  I would put Google Reader as my #1 or #2 most important application used in my daily life.  I depend on Google Reader to deliver my feeds from 400+ sources I have cultivated over 3+ years.   Google Reader is my knowledge intake and management system.

<a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/11/now-available-with-google-apps-google.html" target="_blank">Google added Google Reader to the Google Apps suite today</a>.  You can now access it as part of your business Google Apps account.

I have been considering migrating all my docs to my Google Apps docs account and begin using my Google Calendar in my Google Apps.   I would then switch my Gmail accounts around and POP into my kinlane@gmail.com via my info@kinlane.com Gmail accounts.

Not that anything would happen to my free Google accounts, but it is definitely worth $50 / year for me to keep my email, events, and document data available and be able to add premium services, and more storage in my account.  I think I will begin the migration during the holidays.
