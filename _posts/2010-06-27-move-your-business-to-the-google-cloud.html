<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 10px;" title="Google Apps" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/googleapps.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="180" align="right" />I was just reading a great <a href="http://www.attentionmax.com/blog/2010/06/moving-your-office-into-the-cloud-2.php" target="_blank">testimonial of moving your business to Google Apps</a>. I use <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/google-apps-google/">Google Apps</a> as a starting point for all my domains, right after purchasing the domain.
