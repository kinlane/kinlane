I started getting more traffic to my blog lately and with that came a bunch of SPAM. I dealt with for about a month than I began searching for a solution.<p></p>
Of course the Wordpress Plugin directory is where to go. I cam across the highly rated <a href="http://www.hybrid6.com/webgeek/plugins/wp-spamfree">Wordpress WP-SpamFree plugin</a>.<p></p>
I highly recommend it, it took care of my SPAM issues and so far I've only seen a handful of real comments.
