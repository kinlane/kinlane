I am seeing more and more talk of crowd sourcing of projects. I am reading more about virtual assistants and how they are changing how businesses operate and grow their business in this tough economy.<br />
<br />
In my work with Ahren over at Social Media Squad I have assisted him in the development of <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com">crowd sourced strategies for social media marketing campaigns</a>.<br />
<br />
It is not without its problems, we have trouble finding quality and reliable talent sometimes....and we fall short of targeted goals from time to time.<br />
<br />
However we are really dialing in some great process for crowd source execution of projects and individual tasks. I have worked with some serious talent that is working from home as a mother, student, or other capacities.<br />
<br />
I am really eager to see where crowd sourcing and virtual assistants go in the mainstream employment and business human resource process.
