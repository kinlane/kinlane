I was Googling my name as I usually do on a Monday morning as part of my personal <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com/services/index.html">reputation management</a>.<br /><br />I noticed a social network profile I signed up for a few months back called <a href="http://www.naymz.com/">Naymz</a> has grown significantly in PageRank as well as made it to the first page on my Google Results.<br /><br />So I figured I better work to complete my profile on it and make it as robust and relevant as possible to the conversation(s) I have positioned myself in.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.naymz.com/">Naymz</a> looks like it has become a great social network profile to use in your <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com/services/index.html">online reputation management campaign</a>.
