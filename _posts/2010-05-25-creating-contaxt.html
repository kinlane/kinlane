Using <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=1336">oAuth I've pulled my email from my Gmail Inbox</a>. Then using AuthSub I pulled my <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/contacts/">Google Contacts</a>. I will replicate what I've done and pull mail and contacts from my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> Google Apps domain.<p></p>
I'm putting all this information into a MySQL database on my server and creating a sort of CRM. Then I will build hooks that publish data back to my FREE and Google Apps domain(s).<p></p>
A few weeks ago I pulled my my information streams from Google Buzz, Google Reader, Twitter, and Read it Later through RSS feeds and APIs.<p></p>
I've also pulled bookmarks from my Delicious and Google Bookmarks.<p></p>
My goal is to combine all this information into some sort of platform that gives context or "contaxt" as <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com">Audrey</a> puts it to my platform. How do all these contacts, communications, streams and bookmarks work together? How do I merge all this together and extract more meaning?<p></p>
Hmmm....we'll see as it comes together.
