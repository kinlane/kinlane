<p></p>
In order to upload larger objects they require you to use the new <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/11/amazon-s3-multipart-upload.html" target="_blank">Multipart Upload API</a>. This uploader allows you to upload the object in parts, increasing the chances it will finisih.

I don't personally have any 1 TB files laying around, let alone a 5TB files, but I'm sure this opens up a lot of new possibilities for using Amazon Web Service for scientific data or media content.
