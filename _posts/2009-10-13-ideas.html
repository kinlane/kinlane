I really like ideas. I have them all the time. I work all the time to organize, prioritize, share and collaborate on my ideas.<a href="http://wordpress.org"><img title="Idea-Management" src="http://kin_lane.s3.amazonaws.com/ideas.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="166" align="right" /></a><p></p>
I love hearing other people's ideas on things.<p></p>
I was just browsing around the <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a> web site and came across their <a href="http://wordpress.org">idea section</a>. I really like this. I think every company should have an idea section where employees, customers, and partners can come and share their ideas on anything.<p></p>
Idea management is a healthy personal and business activity, it should be encouraged.
