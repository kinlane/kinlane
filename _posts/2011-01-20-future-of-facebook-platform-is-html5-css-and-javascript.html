Facebook is jumping on the <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/html-5/">HTML5</a> bandwagon and <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/448" target="_blank">supporting it within their developers community</a>.

They are counting on HTML5 helping developers operate across web, desktop and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> devices. They are proposing that all you would need to build <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> apps is HTML, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/javascript/">JavaScript</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/css/" target="_blank">CSS</a>.
<p></p>
They are holding a Tech Talk on this subkinlane-productions2nesday, January 26 at 7PM</strong>.
