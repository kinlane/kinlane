I just launched my first Amazon EC2 instance in the new US West Region. They recently extended the cloud to a Northern California region.<p></p>
So I thought I' d test drive with a new instance and went ahead and reserved 5 IP address for use with other instances.<p></p>
Can't wait to see a South America, Asian and other Regions for easy global cloud deployment.
