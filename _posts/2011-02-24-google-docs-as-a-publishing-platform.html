<p></p>Google Docs has always been a singular document editor for me. When you step back and look at it from 100K foot, you start to see a bigger picture.
<p></p>I'm seeing the potential of Google Docs as a publishing platform. Google Docs can support publishing in three main areas:
<p></p><strong>Document Management</strong>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Mobile</strong> - Hand held, cellular access to creating, editing, sharing and publishing documents.
          <ul class="mainlist">

               </li>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Web</strong> - Superior web-based, cross platform document management application.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Language Translation -</strong> Language translate during upload and document management in over 50 langugages.
     </li>

     </li>

     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Commercial Cloud Printing -</strong> Printing of Google Docs from any mobile or desktop devices to any commercial printer provider over the Internet.
     </li>
</ul>Google is bringing together some very powerful document management tools for developers to take advantage of.
<p></p>As I'm planning for development of Google Cloud Printers, I am beginning to see much more opportunity for publishing beyond just a way to print, its a full blown publishing platform.
