<img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-docs-icon.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I spent some time this evening researching file size limitations for Google Docs.  Here is what I found:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Documents</strong> - 512,000 characters, regardless of the number of pages or font size. Uploaded document files that are converted to Google documents format can't be larger than 1MB.</li>
	<li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> - Uploaded spreadsheet files that are converted to Google spreadsheets format can't be larger than 20MB, and need to be under 400,000 cells and 256 columns per sheet.</li>
	<li><strong>Presentations</strong>: - Presentations created in Google Docs can be up to 10MB -- which is about 200 slides.</li>
	<li><strong>Drawings</strong> - There is no document size limitation posted.</li>
</ul>
One thing I did not know was that files you upload, but do not convert to Google Doc format can be up to <a class="zem_slink" title="Gigabyte" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte">1GB</a> in size.
<p></p>
I have been concerned with using Google Docs as primary cloud storage because I always seem to be getting yelled at for file size too large on upload. However I'm always converting file at upload.
<p></p>
1GB is plenty big for any file I will be storing in the clouds. If I need bigger I can use Amazon S3.
