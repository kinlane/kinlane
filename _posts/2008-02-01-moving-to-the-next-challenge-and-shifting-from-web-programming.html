I waiting a while before I started blogging about this topic until everything was in place.  It seems all the pieces have fallen in place so I am going to start on this new path.<br /><br />Tomorrow 2/1/2008 is my last day a lead web application developer at <a href="http://www.paloalto.com">Palo Alto Software</a>.  I gave notice 2 weeks ago and on 2/6/2008 I will be started a new job with <a href="http://www.altrec.com/">Altrec </a>in Redmond, Oregon.<br /><br />I am shifting my career a little after almost 20 years as a programmer.  The first ten years was primarily database programming with the last ten years building web applications. <br /><br />Now I am changing course a little bit, I won't ever stop programming, I am shifting into more of a Social Media Architect.  I am taking my knowledge of data and API's, coupled with web application development and most recently AJAX development, and marrying it together with a passion for social media. <br /><br />All that equals Social Media Architect.<br /><br />I am excited about working with Altrec and assisting them with their social media, API, and other technical needs for the future.  I haven't started yet so I really don't know exactly what will happen.<br /><br />Anyways I just wanted to draw the line in the sand on the blog here. <br /><br />I will miss working with all my friends at <a href="http://www.paloalto.com">Palo Alto Software</a>, it has been a great couple of years.
