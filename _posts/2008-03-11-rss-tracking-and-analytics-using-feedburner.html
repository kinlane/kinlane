I have bee spending the week finding many types of RSS feeds for different purposes. I am building large lists of them under different topics and tracking the source of these feeds.<br />
<br />
I am noticing about 1 in 10 feeds are using Feedburner or any type of tracking for it.<br />
<br />
Though I am happier at the amount of quality data available via RSS it concerns me that people who have employed RSS do not understand the the value of tracking their RSS consumption and usage.<br />
<br />
I really think there is a huge need for continued education around RSS in all age and business levels, it is really not understood by the masses.
