I was just reading about Research in Montion and their innovation in <a class="zem_slink" title="Fast Company (magazine)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.fastcompany.com">Fast Company</a> and about their applicaiton directory in <a class="zem_slink" title="BusinessWeek" rel="homepage" href="http://www.businessweek.com/">Business Week</a>.<p></p>
I was also reading about <a class="zem_slink" title="Vodafone" rel="homepage" href="http://www.vodafone.com/">Vodafone</a> in Business Week.<p></p>
Seems that open platforms and creating application directories are all the rage. All the mobile providers are seeing the success of namely <a class="zem_slink" title="List of iPhone applications" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iPhone_applications">IPhone apps</a> and jumping on the band wagon.<p></p>
So several thoughts are going through my head. Are mobile apps the next web? When you build a site for your company do you have to build applications for major mobile platforms too?<p></p>
I am seeing <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> being used for webbooks as well as <a class="zem_slink" title="Mobile phone" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone">mobile phones</a>. It just seems like there were desktop apps, then there was the web. Now you have to consider <a class="zem_slink" title="IPhone OS" rel="homepage" href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/">IPhone</a>, Blackberry, Android and other top players now when building online / cloud tools for your company.<p></p>
I am sure this is asking a lot of small businesses who just realized that building for the web is a priority. Seems like the next wave though. Cloud enabled applications that run on any top mobile or web environment.
