<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Programmable Web" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/images/logo2.png" alt="" width="190" height="72" align="right" />I was just reading on the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/06/29/programmableweb-joins-alcatel-lucent/">Programmable Web</a> blog that they were acquired by <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>. Not sure what this means for their content and direction.<p></p>
I have always followed programmable web because they are the best place to discover new APIs. Hopefully they can stay objective and stay focused on the next generation of API development.
