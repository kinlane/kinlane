I was just driving home tonight and thinking about all the widgets and OpenSocial applications I have been developing lately.<br /><br />Starting thinking about the limited distribution OpenSocial Applications and the wide distribution of widgets.<br /><br />I was playing with a real sweet Flash Distribution that was driven from XML.  I was thinking about the different ways I could distribute it on web sites and social networks.<br /><br />Of course I think about how to make some use it and adopt it. <br /><br />Then I thought, is it really necessary to have some continue using an application? <br /><br />Can they just add it, get some value, and send back?<br /><br />If 100 people use and adopt it or 10,000 use it and lose it...what is more valuable.<br /><br />Just curious.
