LinkedIn just announced they are offering that, "<a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/blog/2008/03/company-profile.html">Now Companies too have profiles on LinkedI</a>n".<br /><br />I have always used LinkedIn as a business facing presence for myself.  It has linkages for all my employees?<br /><br />Now, you'll be able to see over 160,000 profiles of companies on LinkedIn, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to non-profit organizations as well as LinkedIn's own Company Profile page.<br /><br />Company Profiles on LinkedIn is an overview of a company's industry data in combination with LinkedIn data along certain key metrics.<br /><br />Seems like a logical step to me.<br /><br />What can it do for a business to have a social network profile on LinkedIn?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>
