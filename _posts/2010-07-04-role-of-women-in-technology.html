As a big dumb white guy, I often fall into the common trap that is set in our society. The trap that white men rule. I get to play dumb to the fact that there is injustice in the world.<p></p>
I've worked with clients where everything is perfect as long as I'm managing the project. As soon as I bring in my right hand (a woman), or my development support, things can go wrong.<p></p>
I (the big dumb white guy) need a constant wake up call (daily) about the "world" I live in.<p></p>
You may feel comfortable in your skin, but there is a lot more going on around you. There is much more influencing you than you may know. You have a lot of control to influence your "buddies", make sure and pay attention.<p></p>
