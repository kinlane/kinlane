<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="HTML5" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/html5.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />As I continue my deep dive into the functional side of HTML5 I am learning about Server-Sent Events. Server-Sent Events enable servers to push data to a web page loaded in the browser.  Think of it as reverse AJAX.

Using the EventSource interface you can register and event listener client side.

Then server side you send messages using a text/event-stream MIME type.

Seems like a much more efficient way of handle server side communications. Changes the way you think UI interactions and where events can be initiated.
