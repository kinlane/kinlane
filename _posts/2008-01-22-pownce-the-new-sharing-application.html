For those of you who don't know Pownce is a application where you can send music, photos, messages, links, events, and more. You can do it all on our web site, or install a lightweight desktop software that lets you get out of the browser.<br />
<div class="c1">
     <br />
</div>It is a pretty interesting little application that allows you to import your contacts from your major networks using Plaxo it looks like.<br />

I like how they <a href="http://www.pownce.com/about/">describe how Pownce is made</a>, check it out.<br />
<br />
They have an API as well that lets you access the user information, friends, and notes for the account.<br />
<br />
Still wrapping my head around how this fits into your daily activity, but I am sure it will come to me. Looks like it is another piece of the puzzle in helping me get control of <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2008/01/definition-of-my-social-graph.html">my social graph</a> and further complete my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2007/11/social-networks-email-and-more.html">single social interface</a>.<br />
<br />
Will share information about it as it comes out.
