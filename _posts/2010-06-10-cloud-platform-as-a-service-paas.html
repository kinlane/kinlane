I was helping someone choose a blogging platform today and they sent me a link for a possible choice. It was <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>.
<p></p>
At first I thought, "This isn't a quick and dirty FREE blogging platform." I left the tab open and quickly setup a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?cat=186">Wordpress</a> blog for them.
<p></p>
I came back to the <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> site and went through their <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/tour/">product tour</a>.
<p></p>
First off, I"m hestitant to 100% call them a Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) because of two missing features, they don't have:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Full Set of API</li>
	<li>Developer Module Ecoysystem</li>
</ul>
However they do have the beginning of a developer ecosystem. So I"m putting them halfway between SaaS and PaaS.
<p></p>
What really stood out is their presentation. The breakout in their product tour reflects the perfect SaaS and almost PaaS structure in my opinion:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Overview - A simple overview of the service.</li>
	<li>Host - A confident review of the cloud hosting platform.</li>
	<li>Build - Builder tools that every site owner looks for.</li>
	<li>Design - Control over the design and layout of your site.</li>
	<li>Manage - Dashboard, management tools, and reporting.</li>
	<li>Support - Clear explanation that their is someone there to support you.</li>
	<li>Developer - Developer / Reseller ecosystem.</li>
	<li>IPhone - Top mobile platform application.</li>
	<li>Importer - Tool to migrate from existing platforms.</li>
	<li>Social - Top social network and social media integration.</li>
</ul>
I consider this an excellent example of PaaS standards. The only elements I would add are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Application Program Interface (API) - A RESTFul API to be able to get at all aspects of platform and services.</li>
	<li>Developer Module Ecosystem - An ecosystem where developers can build custom code modules for the clients, similar to Wordpress Plugins. =</li>
	<li>Android - Application and support for Android mobile platform.</li>
</ul>
With a robust developer ecoystem that has reseller tools, template system, and development modules it would truly be dubbed a high quality <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?cat=163">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</a>.
<p></p>
They have the greatest explanation of why they aren't FREE. "<a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> provides a premium, time saving service and charges for it.".
<p></p>
Its nice to see a quality platform running in the clouds, I predict good things for <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>.
