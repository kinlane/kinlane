I have had several talks with small businesses about their comapnies infrastructure and what the next steps are. When I bring up <a class="zem_slink" title="Cloud Computing" rel="wikinvest" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Cloud_Computing">cloud computing</a>, the first question I get is in regards to security. How secure is our data, our apps?<p></p>
Valid questions and cloud service providers have a lot of proving to do here in alleviating the concerns of small and medium sized businesses wanting to move into the cloud.<p></p>
I agree I need more proof regarding how secure things are at <a class="zem_slink" title="Amazon" rel="homepage" href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a> or other cloud providers, but really I don't see much more proof when it comes to the hosting your servers and data at your favorite ISP and Hosting Provider.<p></p>
I think people just are used to it, been doing it for a while....so they feel secure.<p></p>
I was just talking with a business who migrated from a local ISP to a more regional one located in Portland. I have colocated at both locations and seen severe internal security violations. I have known people who worked there that were less than "secure". But because there are "policies" in place and the illusion of security...and you can touch your servers....its all good.<p></p>
I'm not trying to discount that Cloud Service Providers need to step up with strong <a class="zem_slink" title="Service level agreement" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_level_agreement">SLA</a>'s and more information to address concerns, but I think also time will heal this.<p></p>
As time goes on and more people make the transition, you will see concerns wash away.
