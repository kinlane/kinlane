I am building out a pretty complex system that really seems like a lot of overhead to get some pretty basic systems up.<br /><br />It involves republishing small subsets of data to various data stores such as MySQL, Amazon S3, GData, or just XML.<br /><br />Then I syndicate web services / feeds in RSS, XML, JSON to those little data stores.<br /><br />I keep getting asked why don't you just allow one central data feed off main data store.<br /><br />From a security and load balancing standpoint the distributed piece just makes sense.  It allows me to publish on a schedule these small data stores for each partner / client.   I can give them access directly to the raw data as well as the feed.<br /><br />Also the feed and data can scale and grow independently of the central data store.  It really helps me to scale data feeds and each partners needs.<br /><br />Alright....just jotting down these thoughts in case I change them..
