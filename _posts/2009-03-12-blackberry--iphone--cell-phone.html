I was watching the recent Reid Hoffman interview on Charlie Rose and they discussed the topic of which handheld he uses.<p></p>
He uses a Blackberry an IPhone as well as regular cell phone. Then Charlie Rose also said he uses the exact same configuration.<p></p>
They said they use:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>IPhone for web surfing</li>
	<li>Blackberry for Calendar, Contacts and Office functionality.</li>
	<li>Cell Phone for calls.</li>
</ul>
Its a funny balance of gadgets....and that they both are like that....wonder how many more professionals are like that.<p></p>
I have 2 Blackberries, just personal and business.
