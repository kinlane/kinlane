<p>I spend a lot of time looking at the websites of companies who are doing cool things in the space. I track on about 2000 companies in the API sector, and as part of this monitoring I add the company name, logo, brief description and usually their Twitter and Github account to my systems on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Using this information I will publish a company as part of any research I do across multiple API business categories like API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a> or <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>. If a company is doing something interesting, I need to be able to quickly find a good quality logo, and short, concise description of what the company does&mdash;something that is easier said than done.</p>
<p>You'd be surprised how hard it is to grab a logo when its in the CSS, and finding a single description of what the company does, something I usually have to go to Crunchbase or Angelist to find, and often have to write myself.</p>
<p>If you want to help people talk about your company and what you are doing, make it easy for them to find a logo, and description. Please don&rsquo;t make us click more than once to find this information--trust me, it will go a long way in helping bloggers, and other people showcase what you are up to.</p>
