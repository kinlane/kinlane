<img src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/gears-code-samples.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />API code samples and software development kits (SDK) are among the most important tools for getting developers up and running with any API.
<p></p>Providing complete sets of code samples for every area of an API and in as many programming languages as you can is important to a developer's (and an API's) success. With complete sets of code samples in a wide variety of programming languages an API has a greater chance of success in getting adoption amongst the wider developer community.
<p></p>Using existing freelance developer communities for developing API SDK and code samples is a great way to build your code libraries with minimum use of internal resources. And in turn, by using Elance developers to build code samples, you've made another move towards establishing a pool of high quality, dependable developers that have experience with an API.
