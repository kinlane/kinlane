It is to do and obviously targeting the non programmer wishing to deploy and syndicate their content and brand.<br /><br />It is a nice drag and drop interface and you can create, deploy, and track all the widgets you deploy.<br /><br />These tools are really going to come into play in 2008 when the average business starts integrating widget syndication into their social media marketing strategies.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_9OGzs28s_k4/R5_cqNOuW7I/AAAAAAAAAwE/-F-rOLwYUAM/s1600-h/Screen+Shot+1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_9OGzs28s_k4/R5_cqNOuW7I/AAAAAAAAAwE/-F-rOLwYUAM/s320/Screen+Shot+1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5161086315653913522" border="0" /></a><br />I am going to build  a couple of them tonight and see what I can create.<br /><br />I will post some more once I get one deployed.
