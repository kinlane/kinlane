I've seen several post by Google that the speed of your web site now matters a great deal in the relevance of your site.

</ul>
I recently gave up my personal co-location server rack I"ve had since 1999, including a set of IP addresses I've maintained for 10+ years. I move my core infrastructure on the Amazon EC2 cloud. I've done this for several clients, but needed to make a decision for my own personal brand and projects.<p></p>
The performance of your site matters. You get what you pay for. If your site relevance and traffic matter to you, what is it worth to you? $5.00 / month, $10.00 / month.<p></p>
My blog performance and related brand properties are valuable to me. I'm willing to pay $90.00 / month to make sure my sites load fast.<p></p>
So I have deployed a small <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Ec2 instance</a> for just my personal brand...<a href="http://www.kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>.<p></p>
It is important to me. Take some time to consider what your online properties are worth to you. And consider deploying a single server for your brand to ensure its given priority in your world, Googles, and beyond.
