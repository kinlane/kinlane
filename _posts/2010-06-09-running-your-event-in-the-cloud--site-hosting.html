Hosting a web site for an event or conference can be costly. Traffic to  the web site spikes around email campaigns, call for papers,  registration opening, before and during the event.<img style="padding: 15px;" title="Events in the Clouds" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/events-in-the-clouds/clouds.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />

Hosting  providers that can handle the volume of traffic around events and  conferences can be expensive. The <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?cat=134">Amazon Cloud</a> is an excellent place to  meet the demanding needs of the event.
<p></p>
Amazon Web Services has  several services that can be taken advantage of:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> for web site hosting, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=1450">cloud email hosting</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS</a> for relational  database management using MySQL</li>
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for storage of PDF,  Word Documents, Video, and Audio</li>
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> for  distribution of content to US, European, and Asian zones for regional  delivery</li>
	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load Balncing</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/">Auto Scaling</a> for event web site  and web application scaling to meet traffic needs</li>
</ul>
One of  the cornerstones of <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?page_id=714">Cloud Computing</a> is the pay for what you use, utility  pricing. This type of pricing and scalability fits well with delivery  Internet services around events and conferences.
<p></p>
It is common to  double or triple your server, storage and bandwidth during important  event milestones. Then once it is done you just need a handful of pages  with little or no traffic.

I'm running 20+ events at any time in  the clouds, I often scale from 10 server to 20 servers to meet the  demand. <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?cat=134">Amazon Cloud</a> works well.
