In 2008 I have started really using <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/search/label/Writing">Blogger as an extension of my idea and content platform</a>.<br /><br />With this post I now have 42 posts for January of 2008 which beats the 41 entries I posted in the entire year of 2007.<br /><br />Really feeling my voice this year.
