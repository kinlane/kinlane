I have explored the sharing and social networking options within my Google Reader. My network has not really grown or evolved. Ocasionally I found someone who had liked an article I really liked and I would add them to my Google Reader network.<p></p>
Since I started using Google Buzz it has brought this social network out in front. It is forcing me to clean up my Google Contacts and starting grouping my network.<p></p>
I spend my entire day in Google Reader. It is logical to build a business and professional network here and to establish and build relationships based upon common interests.<p></p>
It is very interesting how the Google Platform is really coming together.
