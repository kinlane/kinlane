I came across a blog post in the Huffington Post called, "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/08/schwarzenegger-proposes-b_n_416750.html">Schwarzenegger Proposes Budget For 'Tough Times</a>'". So I went and checked out the <a href="Schwarzenegger Proposes Budget For 'Tough Times'">California Proposed Budget for 2010 and 2011</a>.<p></p>
I am seeing a lot of PDF documents available regarding the budget, but no data feeds or spreadsheets.<p></p>
I went ahead and plugged the <a href="http://californiabudget.laneworks.net/index.php">California Budget</a> into the <a href="http://californiabudget.laneworks.net/index.php">budget priority</a> tool I have been building.<p></p>
You view the <a href="http://californiabudget.laneworks.net/index.php">California Budget Prioritization Tool</a> i built and register for your own account.<p></p>
The hardest part about plugging these budgets into the prioritization tool is getting the budget data normalized. Everything else is smooth.
