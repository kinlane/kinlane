I have been really getting into answering questions on LinkedIn's answers section.  I have the technology areas on my RSS feed so when they come in.  I find I learn a lot from some of the questions posed.  Not just answering questions for people.<br /><br />I have also have really made a lot of connections doing this.  I was just thinking about what a wonderful opportunity it is to make one on one connections with people and make a good first impression by helping them solve a problem.
