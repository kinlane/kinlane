I went ahead and signed up for Bebo Social Network tonight.  I was reading a blog post on Techcrunch called <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/10/bebos-platform-now-open-for-all-developers/">Bebo's Platform Now Open for All Developers</a> and thought I should go ahead check it out for myself.<br /><br />I belong to most of the major Social Networks now and was reading the other day on how <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jan/04/socialnetworking.bebo">Bebo was named as best social networking site in a survey</a> and is beating out Facebook<br /><br />It is a very clean application similar to Facebook.  Which I like.  That is one thing about MySpace that really bothers me is how it is so cluttered and just crappy looking.<br /><br />I like the video, music and authors sections that really highlights the major aspects of our social worlds.<br /><br />They don't have too many applications right now, I noticed one business application allowing you to podcast. <br /><br />This gives me yet <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com">another social network profile to manage</a>, but hey it all increases my presence.<br /><br />Will keep poking around and see what it has to offer.
