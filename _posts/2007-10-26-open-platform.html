To achieve the perfect platform for how I operate and think I don't think one company can deliver by themselves.<br /><br />To create the perfect suite or set of tools that I need to operate on a daily basis I need different applications that interact and operate on a common standard and interface.<br /><br />I need to be able to try different perspectives and approaches.<br /><br />If an application doesn't work for me I need to be able to say NO! This doesn't work dammit, and show me others like it so I can try more.<br /><br />I don't want to have to worry about my data, it stays with me!<br /><br />I fire up the new application and it works for me, and my data is all in there.<br /><br />Sure the bigs boyz can fight over who will give me my base platform. Google works for me, but Yahoo may for you. Windows Live maybe be a better option.<br /><br />However you need to let vendors share their warez and offer them to me in a safe environment. They can peddle whole systems or just objects and features. Maybe they can perform a service for me. Something like Salesforce Appshare with a more Firefox Add-on feel.
