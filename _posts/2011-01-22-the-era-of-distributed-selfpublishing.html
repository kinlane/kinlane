Its interesting to watch <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/publishing/">self-publishing</a> move mainstream and gain more acceptance. The conversation seems to be moving from, Is self-publishing a viable option? to Self-publishing is the way to go!.kinlane-productions2kinlane-productions2
<p></p>Services like <a href="http://www.lulu.com/" target="_blank">Lulu.com</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/seller-account/mm-summary-page.html?topic=200260520" target="_blank">Amazon self publishing</a> are empowering many authors to self-publish their works and handle the business side of getting their work sold. Keeping more of the profits in their pockets. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/open-book.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /> This is definitely a viable option for many authors, however I think there will always be a place for niche publishing houses. Not every author is up for the task of promoting their own <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/publishing/">Book</a>.
<p></p>With the acceptance of self-publishing, the evolution of self-publishing technologies like <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> Connect <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/cloud-print/">Cloud Print</a>, we will see a lot more publishing houses pop up. These small publishers will provide distribution, marketing, and on-demand or small run publishing services.
<p></p>I would like to see more open-source projects that support self-publishing platforms for books, photos, posters, cards and other popular print formats. This would provide a platform for aspiring publishers that have connections or a expertise in a particular format or subject area.
<p></p>Publishers could employ open-source publishing platforms that utilize cloud print APIs to get their products printed, then provide additional services beyond just <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/publishing/">printing</a> for their customers. This would leave their authors to do what they do best. These niche publishers could provide their authors with the attention they need and cater to a specific audiences. Long-tail audiences that larger self-publishing providers don't have the time for or expertise in.
<p></p>I think we are slowly entering an era of distributed self-publishing, where publishing is being democratized using new publishing platforms and cloud print APIs.
