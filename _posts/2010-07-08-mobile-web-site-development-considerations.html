<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 10px;" title="Mobile Browser" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile-site-development/mobile-browser.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I'm refining my strategy for best practices in designing mobile web sites. I just added a few RSS feeds from quality design firms, and added a Google Alert. I've put together a few things to consider when designing your web site for mobile browsers:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Keep it Simple</li>
	<li>Use White Space</li>
	<li>Make Wise Use of Images</li>
	<li>Employ Mobile Specific Sub-Domains</li>
	<li>Only Include High Value Content</li>
	<li>Support Many Popular Screen Sizes</li>
	<li>Rapid Change of Mobile Industry</li>
	<li>Important Features / Essential</li>
	<li>Know and Target Your market</li>
</ul>
Developing a web site or web application that runs well in mobile browsers doesn't have to be a huge undertaking, but you should put together a plan and consider these simple points.   More to come as I keep blending together my<a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/html-5/"> learning of HTML5</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/mobile-site-development/">development of mobile websites</a>.
