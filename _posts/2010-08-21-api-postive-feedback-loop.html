A positive feedback loop can occur whenever an API becomes popular, it keeps becoming more and more popular due to network effects.<p></p>
The most important network effects are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>API gets support by partners</li>
	<li>API gets support by vendors</li>
	<li>Developers are more likely to already know how to use it.</li>
</ul>
This feedback loop and network effect are the momentum you need to create in your API community.<p></p>
