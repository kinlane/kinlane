<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 10px;" title="Cloudberry Backup" src="http://images.cloudberrylab.com/products/backup_box.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="170" align="right" />I am always trying to keep an eye on various <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/06/data-storage-in-the-clouds/">cloud storage solutions</a>. A company called <a href="http://cloudberrylab.com" target="_blank">Cloudberry</a> has been offering an <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-s3/">Amazon S3</a> storage client called <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2009/04/amazon-s3-client-tool/">CloudBerry Explorer</a> for a while.<p></p>
Now they are targeting the data backup and restore marketing with their <a href="http://cloudberrylab.com/default.aspx?page=cloudberry-backup">CloudBerry Backup</a>. Current features include:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Maintain the same data structure on AmazonS3 as you have on your local computer</li>
	<li>Support for Amazon Reduced Redundancy Storage</li>
	<li>Asia Pacific Region support</li>
	<li>Secure Storage</li>
	<li>Data Versioning</li>
</ul>
Features coming soon are:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Expose Amazon S3 storage as a local disk on your computer</li>
	<li>Storage costs estimates</li>
	<li>Web interface</li>
	<li>FTP support</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.nirvanix.com/products-services/storage-delivery-network/index.aspx" target="_blank">Nirvanix Storage Delivery Network</a> support</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/windowsazure/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Blob Storage</a> support</li>
</ul>
Interesting to see another player in the cloud backup game. <a href="http://cloudberrylab.com" target="_blank">CloudBerry</a> seem to be going down similar road as Jungle Disk with their support of alternate cloud storage providers Nirvanix, and Microsoft Azure Blog Storage. I would still like to see one provider offer a standard cloud storage client for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL </span>cloud storage providers.
