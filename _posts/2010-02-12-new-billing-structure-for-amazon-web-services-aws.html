<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> has added a new and more flexible way to manage an account. They have added the ability for:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Consolidated billing across multiple AWS accounts</li>
	<li>Volume pricing across more than one AWS account</li>
	<li>Way to track the cost of a project across an organization.</li>
</ul>
The new billing<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/consolidated-billing" target="_blank"></a> feature lets you designate one AWS account as a <em>paying</em> account and a set of other accounts as <em>linked</em> accounts to form a simple one-level hierarchy. The AWS usage within the linked accounts is rolled up into the paying account for volume pricing and billing purposes, so there's just one AWS bill per month.<p></p>
The account relationship is solely for accounting purposes and normal AWS permissions still apply. You can set up AWS accounts for projects, departments, dev/test/staging/production, or even by employee. You can add up to twenty linked accounts to a single paying account.<p></p>
These features will do a lot to address the needs of larger customers.. Later this year <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> is planning to provide additional functionality to allow linking of accounts and user permissions.
