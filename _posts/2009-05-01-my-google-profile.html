I was waiting for my Google Profile to float up in my listings.  I watch the top 20 Google search results for my name fairly often. It is important to me what shows there.

I had extended my Google Profile a couple weeks ago when I first heard they were offering more features here.

I have not seen it in my top search results, being Google I assumed it would float up pretty quickly.

It showed up today as #10.  I clicked on....and it gave me an option to order business cards for free.  It is just the Google Search box with my name in there.  Pretty funny...I am ordering just cause its FREE.
