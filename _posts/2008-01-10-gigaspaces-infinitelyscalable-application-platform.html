Was introduced to GigaSpaces today by a friend at the University of Oregon.  What an amazing application platform.  It truly an infinite scaling application that just doesn't handle the back-end tier, it tackles the business layer as well.<br /><br />This is similar to the technology that Google and Amazon have built for themselves and their offerings. <br /><br />They also have an <a href="http://www.gigaspaces.com/ec2/">GigaSpaces Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</a> that is publicly available, and there is a <a href="http://www.gigaspaces.com/ec2/">white paper available for the GigaSpaces EC2 Machine Image</a>.<br /><br />Gigaspaces support for Java, .Net (C#), and C++.  They are also working on a presentation layer that works with the likes of Flash / Flex, AJAX, and Microsoft Silverlight.<br /><br />They are reworking their pricing right now, however their target audience is the small business and startups so it should be affordable.  They also have a <a href="http://www.gigaspaces.com/os_downloads.html#g">community version available of Gigaspaces</a>.<br /><br />I am going to do a little more homework here.
