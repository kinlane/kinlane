I was just thinking how much information I am putting on the Internet.  I pretty much migrated to a web-existence completely. <br /><br />Only think I store locally are temporary files and my music. <br /><br />I store all my thoughts in my Google Notebook, all my docs on Google Docs.  This is a lot of trust. What happens if my Google Account just goes away?<br /><br />What would make me feel better about the storage of all my information not from a privacy point of view, but from a backup perspective.<br /><br />I have thought about using another Google Account and the Google API to move the data from my primary account to a secondary or backup Google Account.  Would take some time but could be done.<br /><br />Now I am also thinking about storing at Amazon S3 or Amazon SimpleDB when ready. <br /><br />I will let everyone know when I make a move on this.
