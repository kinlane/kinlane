I was playing with <a href="http://wave.google.com">Google Wave</a> tonight. I am curious to see how I can use it. I keep thinking about using Google Wave as a <a class="zem_slink" title="Content management system" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management system</a> (CMS).
<p></p>
I am starting with the basics. First I started a new wave and filled it with some dummy content.kinlane-productions2
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Google Wave CMS Editor" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/google-wave_embed/Wave-CMS-Editor.jpg" alt="" width="536" height="238" />
<p></p>
Then using the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/wave/embed/">Google Wave Embed API</a> I can quickly grab the Wave ID and embed it in a web page using a simple little JavaScript that creates and manipulates a Google Wave Embed Panel.
<blockquote>&lt;script src="embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
function initialize() {
var wavePanel = new WavePanel('http://wave.google.com/a/wavesandbox.com/');
wavePanel.loadWave('wavesandbox.com!w+Fe5fw2vJA');
<p></p>
var conf = new WavePanel.UIConfig();
conf.setBgcolor("#ffffff");
conf.setFont("arial");
conf.setFontSize("10px");
conf.setToolbarEnabled(0);
wavePanel.setUIConfigObject(conf);
<p></p>
wavePanel.init(document.getElementById('waveframe'));
wavePanel.setEditMode(0);
}
&lt;/script&gt;</blockquote>
This means I could easily create a dynamic web site that would pull from some sort of dynamic sitekinlane-productions2te outline with corresponding Google Wave ID. The Wave would handle all the user edit permissions.
<p></p>
Then using the sitemap you could create some sort of graphical look for the site that built the menu, submenus, and bread crumbs on the fly.
<p></p>
You could easily create an administrative tool that would allow a webmaster to create new sections, pages and it would automatically create new waves, and setup user permissions from Google Wave contacts.
<p></p>
Right now Google has wave embed limited to the Google Wave Sandbox. So its hard to tell what the public will see.

<p style="text-align: left;">This is just one page, however I can see the potential. You can basically crowd source the management of a web site across many different people using Google Wave.
<p style="text-align: left;">I still have some public and user editing isuess on the embed page to figure out. I will also create some sort of web site registry tool that will build the site map and handle organizing all the waves.
