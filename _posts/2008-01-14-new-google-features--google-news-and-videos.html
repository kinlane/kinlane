I never really know when they come out, but when I find them they are new to me so I am blogging about them.<br />
<br />
I was reading Google News as I do daily and noticed a little + sign next to one of my Recommended for Kin Lane articles.<br />
<br />
So I click on it and I get a news video from Youtube related to the news article.<br />
<br />
Definitely blurring the lines between what I think of as traditional news journalism and new media.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_9OGzs28s_k4/R4wuZ0gj36I/AAAAAAAAAuM/Mpj1fO4djjw/s1600-h/Google+News+2.jpg"><img class="c1" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_9OGzs28s_k4/R4wuZ0gj36I/AAAAAAAAAuM/Mpj1fO4djjw/s320/Google+News+2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5155546694559195042" border="0" /></a><br />
<br />
Definitely an important view of how important a Universal Online and Social Media Marketing Strategy can be.<br />
<br />
The more content you have on a topic the more prominence and exposure you can get.<br />
<br />
So when you publish an article, publish related photos, videos, and any other related content you can find.<br />
<br />
All the players are really cross referencing everything.
