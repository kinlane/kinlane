<p><a title="Twitter Boostrap" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563" title="Twitter-Bootstrap-Bird" src="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Twitter-Bootstrap-Bird.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>I&rsquo;m a web application developer. I can efficiently build web applications, but when it comes to the UI, I know what looks good, but I struggle to actually implement a consistent look and feel.</p>
<p>Usually in a weekend I can throw together a pretty complete app, but when I try to make it look good it can take weeks, and often even kills a project before it get going.</p>
<p>This is why I started using&nbsp;<a title="Twitter Boostrap" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>&nbsp;for all my web applications and prototypes. Twitter Bootstrap is a &ldquo;simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the earlier days of Twitter, engineers used almost any library they were familiar with to meet front-end requirements. Inconsistencies among the individual applications made it difficult to scale and maintain them. Bootstrap began as an answer to these challenges and quickly accelerated during Twitter&rsquo;s first Hackweek. By the end of Hackweek, they had reached a stable version that engineers could use across the company.</p>
<p>With the help and feedback of many engineers, Bootstrap has grown significantly to encompass not only basic styles, but more elegant and durable front-end design patterns. Providing a collection of CSS and HTML conventions, employing the latest browser techniques to deliver typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation and many of the common elements you need to deliver a sharp looking web application.</p>
<p>I used Twitter Bootstrap to deploy&nbsp;<a title="Hyp3rL0cal" href="http://hyp3rl0cal.com/">Hyp3rL0cal</a>, my first set of local web app prototypes in PHP, Python and Ruby, built using the&nbsp;<a title="CityGrid Places and Advertising API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Content+by+CityGrid">CityGrid Places and Advertising API</a>. I&rsquo;ve rolled up these prototypes, complete with Twitter Bootstrap as&nbsp;<a title="Amazon EC2 AMIs" href="http://phplibraries.hyp3rl0cal.com/citygrid-amazon-machine-image-ami.php">Amazon EC2 AMIs</a>, so anyone can quickly deploy a local directory that looks good.</p>
<p>I highly recommend using&nbsp;<a title="Twitter Boostrap" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>&nbsp;in all your projects, it allows you to focus on what you do best, delivering the next generation of local directory or guide web applications.</p>
