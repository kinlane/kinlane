<a href="http://www.elasticstack.com/" target="_blank">TelasticStack allows you to offer your own brand of cloud servers</a>:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Turnkey Cloud Platform</li>
	<li>Deployment Within Days</li>
	<li>No UpFron Investment</li>
	<li>Scalable Cloud Server</li>
	<li>Modern Virtualization Back-End</li>
	<li>Full Managed Operations</li>
</ul>
They say they have cloud hosting solutions for:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Existing hosting providers</li>
	<li>Cloud Startups</li>
	<li>Private Clouds</li>
</ul>
Seems like a viable business model in the cloud computing game. With everyone jumping on the "cloud" bandwagon a private label solution seems like a perfect option.
