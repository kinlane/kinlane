Been pissed off for a couple days because my new browser tab in Firefox doesn't fit up there anymore because of some new search box.  

Haven't had time to figure out why....but keep fumbling because I can't add tab and have to use file menu.

Then I noticed the keyboard shortcut for it....and I found its actually faster and I'm training myself to use.

Don't fight change...it might make your life better.
