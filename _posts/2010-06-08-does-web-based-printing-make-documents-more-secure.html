I've been paying attention to the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/">Google Cloud Print</a> project at Google  Code. With Google Cloud Print you can:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li> Register any printer to be accessible via the Internet for printing by authorized users</li>
	<li> Allow authorized users to print to this device with multiple devices (desktop,  laptop, mobile phone)</li>
</ul>
Seem like as a business owner I would be able to temporarily open up my  printer for a client, vendor or customer and allow printing. Then the person printing  could send a document straight to the printer without actually sharing any  digital files.<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/"><img src="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/images/overview.gif" alt="" align="right" /></a><p></p>
<strong>Would this make documents more secure?</strong><p></p>
I could send only printed copies to someone I wanted to view my document. Since it  was transmitted over the web, the document transmission could be logged showing that a single  print copy license was delivered to this business at this address.<p></p>
Seems like it could add a new layer to secure document sharing.
