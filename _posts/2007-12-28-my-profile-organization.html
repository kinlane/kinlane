In a few of my last posts I talk about organizing myself and developing a routine.  One thing I am working on is creating a platform and routine that I work on everyday to help organize my world both internally and externally.<br /><br />I have started by creating an outline in Google Docs that I keep updated.  This has all the elements of my world.  It is pretty large so I won't list here.  But it outlines everything about myself and what I am working on.<br /><br />I run down this outline at least once per day and and see what has changed and what needs maintenance.<br /><br />I am using Blogger to keep track of a lot of this and using it as part of the platform for tracking the data.  It is one piece of how I use Google as a Content Platform.<br /><br />I will keep refining this and posting my perspective of this.
