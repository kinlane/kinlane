<a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone c1" title="LinkedIn" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/LinkedIn.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2010/06/25/linkedin-api-developers/trackback/" target="_blank">LinkedIn released some changes to their LinkedIn Open API</a> today. They have:
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Increased Search API Throttle</strong> - They've increased the Search API throttle by 400%.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Increased Access to Profile Data -</strong> Users who have granted access you will now get full profile data.
     </li>
</ul>Looks like they are slowly increasing the value of their API. They seem to really take this process seriously and just rolling out features incrementally.
