I was reading through my blogs today and came across the post from Download Squad on <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/01/06/amazon-launches-software-downloads/">Amazon Launches Software Downloads</a>.<br /><br />I dug around a little more and saw where you can manager your Media Library on Amazon including E-Docs, Amazon Shorts, Unbox Videos, Kindle Books, Kindle Newspapers, Kindle Blogs, Kindle Blogs, Amazon Mp3 and Software Downloads.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_9OGzs28s_k4/R4Fo3Ugj33I/AAAAAAAAAtc/MRjto_t6VN0/s1600-h/amazon+digital+text+platform1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_9OGzs28s_k4/R4Fo3Ugj33I/AAAAAAAAAtc/MRjto_t6VN0/s320/amazon+digital+text+platform1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5152514748295929714" border="0" /></a><br />Found it interesting that they give you an area to manage all of your digital material that you purchase through Amazon as a customer.<br /><br />Then I thought well there must be a flip side to this service and logged into my Amazon Web Services account and foudn I could sign up for the Amazon Digital Text Platform.  This allows me as a publisher to publish my digital text content.   It talks like it is exclusively for E-Books and for Kindle, however beyond the surface it looks like you could manage all your digital content here and post for sale on Amazon.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_9OGzs28s_k4/R4FpB0gj34I/AAAAAAAAAtk/PMk00zKvGOc/s1600-h/amazon+digital+text+platform2.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_9OGzs28s_k4/R4FpB0gj34I/AAAAAAAAAtk/PMk00zKvGOc/s320/amazon+digital+text+platform2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5152514928684556162" border="0" /></a><br />I will play around with more and see what comes of it.  I am interested in publishing some of my micro / mini books here on various technology and marketing topics.  Let you guys know how it goes.
