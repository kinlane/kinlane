Just got a request to install Wordpress blog for a client that will potentially receive a large amount of traffic.<br /><br />So I opted to use the Mosso.com Cloud Hosting Platform by Rackspace.  Took me less than 10 minutes to setup the site, install, and configure the Wordpress blog.<br /><br />In my Mosso.com admin interface and added a new web site, chose to use PHP 5 as core technology and chose mysql as the database.<br /><ul class="mainlist"><li>Once setup and created a MySQL database.</li><li>I FTP'ed the unzipped wordpress contents.</li><li>Updated the wp-config.php file.</li><li>Ran the install.<br /></li></ul>Then I was done.  A scalable Wordpress installation that will handle a large volume of traffic and hosting is cheap.  I could offer as low as $4.95 / month. <br /><br />May just do that.
