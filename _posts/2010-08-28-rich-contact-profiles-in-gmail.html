<img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Rapportive" src="http://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/Rapportive.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />In addition to <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/08/my-social-crm/">adopting Gist</a>, I have quickly adopted a new tool that shows you <a href="http://rapportive.com/" target="_blank">rich contact profiles right inside Gmail</a>. It is called <a href="http://rapportive.com/" target="_blank">Rapportive</a>.
<p></p>
I have heard about them, and <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com" target="_blank">Audrey</a> uses them, but until I watched them present at <a href="http://ycombinator.com/dday.html" target="_blank">YC DemoDay</a> it didn't really stick.
<p></p>
As soon as I got home I installed <a href="http://rapportive.com/" target="_blank">Rapportive</a> in Firefox and Chrome. Amazing!
<p></p>
You get so much intelligence on each contact in your Gmail inbox. I started searching for old contacts just to see what it would show.
<p></p>
<a href="http://rapportive.com/" target="_blank">Rapportive</a> is an essential tool in my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/08/my-social-crm/">social CRM</a> toolbox.
