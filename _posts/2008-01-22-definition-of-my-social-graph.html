I keep talking about what my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2007/11/social-networks-email-and-more.html">single social interface</a>, which I have been wrestling with as part of my social graph.  Figured I better clarify for some of you what the social graph is?<br /><br />A social graph consists of who an individual is connected to based on the type of connections, such as work, friendship, interests, and location.<br /><br />I am still grasping the definition of my social graph as I participate more and more on social networks and in the social media space.<br /><br />In my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2007/11/social-networks-email-and-more.html">single social interface</a> definition I try to define communication with my social graph in another perspective based upon Individuals, Network, and Public.<br /><br />That could be a mix of many different people across my social graph.<br /><br />I am also still fumbling with how all my content and information fits into this picture and where does it show on my social graph as I create, share and collaborate within my social graph?<br /><br />It is great to see different people perspectives on the social graph how they work to define it as well.
