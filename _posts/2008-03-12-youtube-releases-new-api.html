Youtube finally has reworked their API to allow for uploading of videos. This was a huge problem in <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com/">integrating YouTube in Social Media Campaigns</a>.<br /><br />Here are some of the things you can do with the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html">YouTube Data API </a>now:<br /><ul class="mainlist"><li>Create a web front end to let people view videos about specific topics. </li><li>Create a desktop application or plugin that plays videos in a customized environment. </li><li>Add related, dynamic video content to your website or application. </li><li>Customise the Flash player to fit the look and feel of your site, device or application </li><li>Add feeds of videos from each of YouTube's 18 international domains </li></ul>The upload was the biggest addition for me. It is something that I have wanted for a while now.However the cool new chrome JavaScript player is pretty awesome too. You can really customize and embed a new user video player experience in any site.
