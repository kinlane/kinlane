<a title="Marco Arment" href="https://twitter.com/#!/marcoarment">Marco Arment</a>, creator of Instapaper just tweeted:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/marcoarment/status/63010410286166016">As an experiment, I temporarily pulled the Free app from the App Store over a month ago. Sales of the paid app remain great. Few complaints.</a>"</em>
What I like most about Arment and Instaper is he experiments with different monetization strategies for his app and API, and shares his thoughts and reasoning with the rest of the world.
<p></p>
I think sharing the stories, as we are all figuring this out is important for the industry as a whole, and it is great marketing.

Arment says it's not just about the money, it's about the product. And he'll blog in detail about it soon.
