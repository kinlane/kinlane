So in the last year I have completely move online.  Everything I do is web-based.  Most of my world exists underneath my Google Account.<br /><br />However I use many other web services to get done what I do everyday.  I can sit down at any computer pretty much and access my world online and get busy.<br /><br />One area I am lacking is a web-based code editor to manage develop my sites and web applications.  I utilize the OWS Architecture for managing a lot of the content on our sites and <a href="http://www.originalwebsolutions.com">build out our dynamic web sites using a CMS system</a>.<br /><br />Though when it comes to building applications and writing code I really don't have many options.  So recently I found a <a href="http://www.cdolivet.net/editarea/">Edit Area a free web-based Javascript Editor</a>.<br /><br />The main features are:<br /><ul class="mainlist"><li>Easy to integrate, only one script include and one function call</li><li>Tabulation support (allow to write well formated source code)</li><li>Search and replace (with regexp)</li><li>Customizable real-time syntax highlighting (currently: PHP, CSS, Javascript, Python, HTML, XML, VB, C, CPP, Pascal, Basic, Brainf*ck)</li><li>Auto-indenting new lines</li><li>Line numerotation</li><li>Multilanguage support (currently: Croatian, Danish, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese)</li><li>Possible PHP gzip compression (compress the 12 core files to one file of ~20Ko)</li><li>Allow multiple instances</li><li>Full screen mode</li><li>Possible plugin integration</li><li>Possible save and load callback functions</li><li>Possible dynamic content management</li><li>Can work in the same environment than "protype" and "mootools"'s like libraries.</li></ul>So I am going to start integrating it into some of my work and servers.  I will let you guys know how it goes.  It will be nice to have this last piece of my world moved online.
